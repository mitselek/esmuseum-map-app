# F022 Aggressive Cleanup Summary

## Date: October 3, 2025

## Performance Optimization Journey

### Before

- **4 API calls** per page load:
  - `loadCompletedTasks()` × 2 (duplicate calls)
  - `useTaskScoring()` × 2 (one per task)

### After

- **1 API call** per page load:
  - `loadCompletedTasks()` × 1 (cached response data)
  - Stats calculated locally from cache

### Result

✅ **75% reduction in API calls**  
✅ **Faster page load**  
✅ **Cleaner codebase**

---

## Files Cleaned Up

### 1. **app/composables/useCompletedTasks.ts**

#### Removed Dead Code

- ❌ `isTaskCompleted(taskId)` - Never used
- ❌ `filterUnvisitedLocations(locations)` - Never used
- ❌ `markTaskCompleted(taskId)` - Never used
- ❌ `markTaskIncomplete(taskId)` - Never used
- ❌ Debug `console.warn('⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️...')` marker

#### Kept Essential Functions

- ✅ `loadCompletedTasks()` - Loads and caches all user responses
- ✅ `getTaskStats(taskId, expectedCount)` - Calculates location-based progress
- ✅ `userResponses` - Cache of all response data
- ✅ `completedTaskIds` - Set of task IDs with responses

**Lines Removed:** ~80 lines of unused code

---

### 2. **app/composables/useTaskDetail.js**

#### Removed Dead Code

- ❌ `getTaskResponseStats()` wrapper function - Never actually called
- ❌ Stats loading logic in `initializeTask()` - `setStats` callback never passed
- ❌ `useTaskResponseStats` import - Unnecessary dependency

**Lines Removed:** ~20 lines of dead code

---

### 3. **app/composables/useTaskResponseStats.ts**

#### DELETED ENTIRE FILE ❌

- File was completely orphaned after cleanup
- No remaining imports or usage anywhere
- Previously made API calls that are now handled by cached data

**Lines Removed:** ~80 lines (entire file deleted)

---

## Architecture Improvements

### Before: Duplicate API Calls

```javascript
// TaskSidebar.vue
onMounted(() => {
  await loadCompletedTasks()  // Call 1
})

watch(tasks, () => {
  await loadCompletedTasks()  // Call 2 (DUPLICATE)
  for (const task of tasks) {
    const stats = await useTaskScoring(task._id)  // Call 3, 4, 5...
  }
})
```

### After: Single API Call with Cache

```javascript
// TaskSidebar.vue
watch(tasks, async () => {
  await loadCompletedTasks(); // Single call - caches ALL response data
  for (const task of tasks) {
    const stats = getTaskStats(task._id, expected); // Local calculation, NO API call
  }
});
```

---

## Data Flow

### New Caching Strategy

1. **Single API call** loads all user responses
2. **Responses cached** in `userResponses` ref
3. **Stats calculated locally** from cache:
   - Filter responses by task ID
   - Count unique location references
   - Calculate progress percentage
4. **Zero additional API calls** for subsequent stats requests

---

## What Still Uses What

### useCompletedTasks (Slimmed Down)

**Used by:**

- `TaskSidebar.vue` - Shows location-based progress (18/27, 1/1)
- Provides cached response data for stat calculations

**Exports:**

- `loadCompletedTasks()` - Fetch and cache responses
- `getTaskStats(taskId, expectedCount)` - Calculate location stats
- `userResponses` - Read-only access to cached data
- `completedTaskIds` - List of task IDs with responses

### useTaskScoring (Still Needed)

**Used by:**

- `TaskDetailPanel.vue` - Detail view scoring and visited locations
- Provides `visitedLocations` Set for map markers (green vs red)
- Cannot be removed yet - still actively used

---

## Testing Verification

### Console Logs After Cleanup

```
✅ Single "loadCompletedTasks CALLED" log
✅ "Loaded 19 responses for 2 unique tasks"
✅ No duplicate API calls
✅ Stats calculated instantly from cache
```

### UI Behavior

- ✅ Task list shows correct progress (18/27, 1/1)
- ✅ Checkmarks appear for completed tasks
- ✅ Completed tasks sorted last
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ All features working as expected

## Impact Summary

| Metric           | Before | After | Improvement |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| API Calls        | 4      | 1     | -75%        |
| Lines of Code    | ~180   | ~100  | -44%        |
| Unused Functions | 4      | 0     | -100%       |
| Dead Code Files  | 1      | 0     | -100%       |
| Debug Noise      | High   | Low   | Better DX   |

---

## Next Steps

### Completed ✅

- Remove duplicate API calls
- Clean up unused functions
- Delete dead code files
- Verify all functionality

### Future Optimizations

- Consider migrating `useTaskScoring` to TypeScript
- Evaluate if `useTaskScoring` can share cache with `useCompletedTasks`
- Profile actual API response times in production
- Monitor cache invalidation scenarios

---

## Breaking Changes

**None.** All external APIs remain unchanged:

- `TaskSidebar.vue` imports remain the same
- `TaskDetailPanel.vue` unaffected
- Return types unchanged
- Backward compatible cleanup

---

## Files Modified

```
app/composables/useCompletedTasks.ts (cleaned up)
app/composables/useTaskDetail.js (cleaned up)
app/composables/useTaskResponseStats.ts (DELETED)
app/components/TaskSidebar.vue (optimized, already done earlier)
```
