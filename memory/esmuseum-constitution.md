# ESMuseum Constitutional Framework

_Immutable principles governing the development of the Estonian Museum Map Application_

**Established**: September 19, 2025  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Authority**: ESMuseum Development Team  
**Scope**: All development activities, feature implementations, and architectural decisions

---

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the foundational principles that govern all development activities within the ESMuseum Map Application project. These principles ensure architectural consistency, maintainability, and quality across all implementations while supporting the educational mission of Estonian museums.

The articles contained herein are **immutable** and must be upheld by all development activities, including AI-assisted code generation, feature specifications, and architectural decisions.

---

## Article I: Vue 3 Composition API Mandate

### Section 1.1: Component Architecture

Every component in the ESMuseum application **MUST** use the Vue 3 Composition API with the `<script setup>` syntax pattern.

### Section 1.2: Legacy Pattern Prohibition

The Options API pattern is **PROHIBITED** for new development. Existing Options API components must be migrated to Composition API during refactoring cycles.

### Section 1.3: Reactivity Standards

- Use `ref()` for primitive reactive values
- Use `reactive()` for object/array reactive state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Use `watch()` and `watchEffect()` for side effects

### Section 1.4: Composable Integration

Components should leverage Vue composables for shared logic, following the `use*` naming convention.

---

## Article II: TypeScript-First Development

### Section 2.1: Type Safety Mandate

All application code **MUST** be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled.

### Section 2.2: Type Annotation Requirements

- No use of `any` type except in extraordinary circumstances with documented justification
- All function parameters and return types must be explicitly typed
- All component props must have comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- All API responses must have defined TypeScript interfaces

### Section 2.3: Interface Standards

```typescript
// Component Props Interface Example
interface TaskDetailProps {
  task: TaskEntity;
  readonly?: boolean;
  showActions?: boolean;
}

// API Response Interface Example
interface EntuTaskResponse {
  _id: string;
  reference: string;
  title: LocalizedString;
  location?: LocationReference;
}
```

### Section 2.4: Type Import Organization

TypeScript types and interfaces must be imported separately from runtime imports, using the `type` keyword.

---

## Article III: Test-Driven Feature Development

### Section 3.1: Implementation Sequence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All feature development **MUST** follow this exact sequence:

1. **Specification Creation**: Complete feature specification with acceptance criteria
2. **Contract Definition**: API contracts and component interfaces defined
3. **Test Writing**: Comprehensive test suite written and validated
4. **Test Validation**: Tests confirmed to FAIL (Red phase)
5. **Implementation**: Code written to satisfy tests (Green phase)
6. **Refactoring**: Code optimization while maintaining test coverage (Refactor phase)

### Section 3.2: Test Coverage Requirements

- Unit tests for all composables and utility functions
- Component tests for all Vue components
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows

### Section 3.3: Contract-First API Development

All API integrations must begin with contract definitions and contract tests before implementation.

---

## Article IV: i18n-First User Interface

### Section 4.1: Internationalization Mandate

All user-facing text **MUST** be internationalized using the @nuxtjs/i18n framework.

### Section 4.2: Supported Locales

- **Primary**: Estonian (`et`)
- **Secondary**: English (`en`)
- **Tertiary**: Ukrainian (`uk`) - for accessibility

### Section 4.3: Text Placement Standards

- Component-specific translations in `<i18n>` blocks
- Shared translations in locale files under `.config/locales/`
- No hardcoded user-facing strings in templates or logic

### Section 4.4: Translation Key Conventions

```javascript
// Hierarchical key structure
t("components.taskSidebar.title");
t("pages.dashboard.welcomeMessage");
t("errors.api.networkFailure");
```

---

## Article V: Entu API Integration Standards

### Section 5.1: Authentication Framework

All Entu API interactions **MUST** use the established OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with proper token management.

### Section 5.2: API Composable Pattern

Entu API interactions must be encapsulated in dedicated composables:

- `useEntuAuth()` for authentication management
- `useEntuApi()` for general API operations
- `useTaskDetail()`, `useLocation()` etc. for entity-specific operations

### Section 5.3: Error Handling Standards

```typescript
// Standardized error response handling
interface APIError {
  success: false;
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
  };
  timestamp: string;
}
```
