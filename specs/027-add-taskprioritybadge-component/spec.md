# Feature Specification: TaskPriorityBadge Component

**Feature Branch**: `027-add-taskprioritybadge-component`  
**Created**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add TaskPriorityBadge component - A Vue 3 component to display task priority with color-coded badges (high/medium/low). Uses Naive UI NTag component. Should be composable and reusable across task lists."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user viewing task lists in the application, I need to quickly identify task priority levels through visual indicators, so that I can focus on high-priority tasks first.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a task with priority "high", **When** the TaskPriorityBadge is displayed, **Then** it shows a red-colored badge with the text "High"
2. **Given** a task with priority "medium", **When** the TaskPriorityBadge is displayed, **Then** it shows a yellow/orange-colored badge with the text "Medium"
3. **Given** a task with priority "low", **When** the TaskPriorityBadge is displayed, **Then** it shows a green-colored badge with the text "Low"
4. **Given** multiple tasks in a list, **When** they have different priorities, **Then** each badge displays the correct color and text for its priority level

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a task has no priority value? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should display "None", hide badge, or show default?]
- What happens when an invalid priority value is provided? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should show error, fallback, or ignore?]
- How does the badge appear in different contexts (compact lists vs. detail views)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Single size or size variants?]

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Component MUST accept a priority value as a prop (high, medium, low)
- **FR-002**: Component MUST display color-coded visual indicators: red for high priority, yellow/orange for medium priority, green for low priority
- **FR-003**: Component MUST display readable text labels: "High", "Medium", "Low"
- **FR-004**: Component MUST be reusable across different parts of the application (task lists, detail views, dashboards)
- **FR-005**: Component MUST integrate with the existing Naive UI component library

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Task Priority**: A categorization value (high/medium/low) that indicates the urgency or importance of a task
- **Badge Display**: A visual element combining color and text to communicate priority at a glance
