# Feature Specifications

This directory contains all feature specifications following spec-kit conventions.

## Structure

Each feature has its own directory:

```text
specs/
├── 001-feature-name/
│   ├── spec.md      # Feature specification
│   ├── plan.md      # Implementation plan (generated by /plan)
│   └── tasks.md     # Task breakdown (generated by /tasks)
├── 002-another-feature/
│   └── spec.md
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Historical Features

Features **001-026** were migrated from legacy `.copilot-workspace/features/` (F001-F026).

These are historical feature specifications from before spec-kit integration.

## New Features

Features **027+** are created using the spec-kit workflow:

```bash
/speckit.specify "Add new feature description"
```

This command will:
1. Find the highest feature number (e.g., 026)
2. Create next number directory (e.g., `specs/027-feature-name/`)
3. Generate `spec.md` from template
4. Create feature branch `027-feature-name`

## Workflow

After creating a spec with `/specify`:

1. **Plan**: `/plan` generates `plan.md` in the feature directory
2. **Tasks**: `/tasks` generates `tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
3. **Implement**: `/implement` executes tasks and creates the feature

See `.specify/README.md` for complete workflow documentation.

**Note**: Original feature files remain in `.specify/features/` for reference until migration is confirmed successful.
