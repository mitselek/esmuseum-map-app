## Notes

### Decision: Option B Selected

**Question**: Should both email AND phone authentication be added, or just email?

**Answer**: Option B - Implement email authentication only

**Rationale**:

- Strictly addresses original stakeholder request for "E-posti põhine autentimine"
- Simpler UI with one additional button
- Faster delivery with reduced scope
- Phone authentication can be added later with minimal effort (same OAuth.ee infrastructure)
