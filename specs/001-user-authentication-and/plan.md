# Implementation Plan: User Authentication System for Estonian War Museum

**Branch**: `001-user-authentication-and` | **Date**: 2025-01-26 | **Spec**: `specs/001-user-authentication-and/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-user-authentication-and/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```text
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend/backend separation detected in existing Nuxt 3 application structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All technical context resolved

### Estonian Digital Identity Integration Research

**Decision**: Hybrid authentication approach supporting both Estonian digital identity and traditional credentials  
**Rationale**: Educational programs serve both Estonian students (with digital ID) and international students (without)  
**Alternatives considered**: Estonian-only (excludes international students), traditional-only (ignores local standards)

### Legacy Implementation Analysis

**Decision**: Reference legacy patterns without direct code copying  
**Rationale**: Constitutional compliance requires fresh implementation with proven patterns as guidance  
**Key patterns identified**: TARA service integration, multi-language support, session management for educational workflows

### Current Codebase Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Extend existing Entu authentication with educational program layer  
**Rationale**: Minimize disruption to working authentication while adding student-specific features  
**Integration points**: `middleware/auth.js`, `composables/useEntuAuth.js`, `server/utils/auth.ts`

### Performance and Security Requirements

**Decision**: Token-based authentication with refresh patterns, 3-second load compliance  
**Rationale**: Constitutional performance requirements and educational session persistence needs  
**Security standards**: GDPR compliance, Estonian data protection, secure educational data handling

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Status**: Ready for execution

### Data Model Design Strategy

**Entities to extract from specification**:

- Student Account: Profile data, program enrollments, authentication preferences
- Authentication Session: Session tokens, expiration tracking, device information  
- Security Event: Login attempts, access monitoring, educational activity logs
- Educational Program Enrollment: Student-program relationships, access permissions

### API Contract Generation Plan

**Authentication Endpoints**:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Student authentication with multiple identity providers
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh for session persistence
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Student profile and enrollment data
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Secure session termination

**Integration with existing Entu patterns**:

- Extend current OAuth flows for educational context
- Maintain compatibility with existing session management
- Add educational program authorization layer

### Contract Test Strategy

**Test coverage for each endpoint**:

- Request/response schema validation
- Authentication flow edge cases
- Educational program access control
- Estonian digital identity integration scenarios

### Progressive Enhancement Design

**No-JavaScript fallback**:

- Server-side rendered authentication forms
- Traditional form submissions for core flows
- Progressive enhancement for improved UX

**Output Plan**: data-model.md, /contracts/*.json, failing test suites, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_  

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_  

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_  

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
