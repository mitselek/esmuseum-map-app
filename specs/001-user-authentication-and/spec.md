## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Museum visitors need to securely log into the ESMuseum platform to access personalized educational content, track their progress through museum tasks, and submit responses to interactive activities. The system must support both Estonian residents using digital identity and international visitors using traditional credentials.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new Estonian museum visitor, **When** they choose to register using Estonian digital ID, **Then** their account is created with verified identity and they can immediately access educational content
2. **Given** an international visitor, **When** they register with email and password, **Then** they receive email verification and can access content after confirmation
3. **Given** a returning user with valid credentials, **When** they log in, **Then** they are authenticated and directed to their personalized dashboard with saved progress
4. **Given** a user who forgot their password, **When** they request password reset, **Then** they receive secure reset instructions and can regain access
5. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** their session expires, **Then** they are safely logged out and can re-authenticate without losing their current activity progress

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Estonian digital ID service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle simultaneous login attempts from different devices?
- What occurs when a user tries to register with an email already in use?
- How does the system respond to repeated failed login attempts?
- What happens if email verification links expire?
