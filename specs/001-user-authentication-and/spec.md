## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

Estonian students participating in War Museum educational programs (Museum School, National Defence Education) need to securely log into the digital learning platform to access their assigned historical learning activities, track their progress through structured educational tasks, and submit responses to assignments. The system must provide secure and verified authentication suitable for formal educational environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an Estonian student assigned to War Museum activities, **When** they log in with their verified credentials, **Then** they are authenticated and can access their assigned historical learning tasks
2. **Given** a returning student with valid credentials, **When** they log in, **Then** they are authenticated and directed to their learning dashboard with saved progress
3. **Given** an authenticated student, **When** their session expires, **Then** they are safely logged out and can re-authenticate without losing their current assignment progress

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the authentication service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle simultaneous login attempts from different devices?
- How does the system respond to repeated failed login attempts?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide secure authentication for Estonian students with verified identity
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain user sessions securely with automatic expiration
- **FR-003**: System MUST log all authentication events for security monitoring
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent multiple failed login attempts through rate limiting
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve student's current educational assignment during authentication flows
- **FR-006**: System MUST support secure logout with session cleanup
- **FR-007**: System MUST comply with GDPR requirements for student data handling
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide Estonian and English language support throughout authentication flows

### Key Entities

- **Student Account**: Represents an Estonian student with authentication credentials, learning profile, language preference, and access permissions for assigned War Museum educational activities
- **Authentication Session**: Represents an active student session with security tokens, expiration time, and device information
- **Security Event**: Represents authentication-related activities including login attempts and security violations for audit purposes in educational context
