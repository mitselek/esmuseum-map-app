**ðŸ“Š Test Results**: 54/54 tests passing (1 skipped)

- Estonian Student Detection: 21/21 tests âœ…
- Profile Cache Management: 19/19 tests âœ…
- Authentication Integration: 11/11 tests âœ… (1 skipped)
- Quick Validation: 3/3 tests âœ…

## Architecture Overview

**Frontend-Only Design:**

- Direct Entu OAuth2 authentication (no server API)
- Client-side profile caching in localStorage
- Student-focused authentication (no educator complexity)
- Composable-based architecture for reusability

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Phase 3.1: Setup

- [x] T001 Create TypeScript interfaces from types.ts in app/types/auth.ts
- [x] T002 Install additional dependencies for authentication (Vitest coverage, Playwright E2E)
- [x] T003 Configure authentication environment variables - created .env from .env.example template

### Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD)

- [x] T006 Integration test direct Entu authentication flow in tests/integration/entu-auth.test.ts
- [x] T007 Integration test localStorage profile management in tests/integration/profile-cache.test.ts
- [x] T008 Integration test educational group access control (removed - simplified for students only)
- [x] T009 Integration test Estonian vs International student detection in tests/integration/student-detection.test.ts

### Phase 3.3: Core Implementation

- [x] T012 Implement Entu authentication composable in app/composables/useEntuProfileAuth.ts
- [x] T013 Implement localStorage profile management composable in app/composables/useProfileCache.ts
- [x] T014 Educational program access utilities (removed - students only architecture)
- [x] T015 Implement student type detection utilities in app/composables/useStudentDetection.ts
- [x] T016 Remove obsolete API endpoint tasks - frontend-only architecture confirmed

### Phase 3.5: Cleanup & Simplification

- [x] T023 Student detection integration testing - Run student detection integration tests
- [x] T031 Fix Integration Test Failures - Simplified codebase for student-only users, removed all educator/teacher functionality, removed unused server middleware

**Key Simplifications Made:**

- âœ… Removed all educator/teacher detection logic
- âœ… Simplified interfaces to student-only authentication
- âœ… Removed role-based access control complexity
- âœ… Removed unused server middleware (frontend-only app)
- âœ… All integration tests passing (54/54)

## ðŸ”„ Active Tasks

### Phase 3.4: Frontend Integration

- [ ] **T018** Polish authentication flow composables with error handling and state management
- [ ] **T019** Connect auth composables to UI components for seamless user experience  
- [ ] **T020** Implement comprehensive error handling across all auth composables
- [ ] **T021** Add caching, lazy loading, and performance optimizations to auth system
- [ ] **T022** Security audit for authentication system and composables

## ðŸ“‹ Future Tasks (Optional Polish)

- [ ] **T024** Unit tests for student detection utilities in tests/unit/
- [ ] **T025** Unit tests for profile cache management in tests/unit/
- [ ] **T026** Performance validation for <200ms authentication response
- [ ] **T027** E2E tests for complete authentication scenarios in tests/e2e/
- [ ] **T028** Accessibility validation (WCAG 2.1 AA) for authentication components
- [ ] **T029** Update documentation with authentication integration guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus

**Priority**: T018 Polish authentication flow - ensuring robust session management, proper error handling, and secure logout functionality for Estonian students accessing War Museum educational platform.

## ðŸ“‹ Core Files

**Authentication Composables:**

- `app/composables/useEntuProfileAuth.ts` - Main authentication logic with Entu OAuth integration
- `app/composables/useProfileCache.ts` - localStorage profile management with expiration
- `app/composables/useStudentDetection.ts` - Estonian ID validation and student status detection
- `app/composables/useEntuApi.ts` - Direct Entu API integration utilities

**Type Definitions:**

- `app/types/auth.ts` - Complete TypeScript interfaces for authentication system

**Tests:**

- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests covering all authentication flows (54/54 passing)
- `tests/unit/` - Unit validation tests for composable loading

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **T018** - Polish authentication flow composables
2. **T019** - Integrate with UI components
3. **T020** - Add comprehensive error handling
4. **T021** - Performance optimizations
5. **T022** - Security audit

Focus on creating a seamless authentication experience for Estonian students accessing War Museum educational content.
