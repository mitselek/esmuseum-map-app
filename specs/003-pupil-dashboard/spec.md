# F003: Pupil Dashboard & Task Management

**Status**: âœ… Completed  
**Implementation Date**: September 5, 2025  
**Type**: Feature Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive pupil dashboard system that allows students to view and manage their assigned tasks through the Entu-based museum education platform. This feature enables students to authenticate, view tasks assigned to their groups, navigate to detailed task views, and submit responses with text, files, and geolocation data.

## Problem Statement

Students needed a dedicated interface to:

- Authenticate securely using existing Entu OAuth system
- View tasks assigned to their educational groups
- Access detailed task information and requirements
- Submit comprehensive responses including text, files, and location data
- Track their response status and completion

## Solution

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Authentication Middleware** (`app/middleware/pupil-auth.js`)

   - Client-side authentication check using localStorage tokens
   - Automatic redirect to login page for unauthenticated users
   - Proper SSR/client-side handling to avoid hydration issues

2. **Pupil Dashboard** (`app/pages/opilane/index.vue`)

   - User group detection via Entu API person entities
   - Task listing based on group membership relationships
   - Server-side filtering for optimal performance
   - Responsive task cards with status indicators
   - Navigation to individual task details

3. **Task Detail Page** (`app/pages/opilane/ulesanne/[id].vue`)
   - Comprehensive task information display
   - Multi-format response submission (text, files, geolocation)
   - User response tracking and status indicators
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Geolocation capture with browser API integration

### Technical Implementation

#### API Integration Improvements

- **Corrected `searchEntities` Usage**: Fixed to use single query object parameter
- **Data Model Compliance**: Proper use of `.string` properties (`email.string`, `_type.string`)
- **Entity Relationships**: Correct handling of `_id` vs `id` for navigation and references
- **Response Unwrapping**: Proper handling of Entu API response structure (`response.entity`)

#### Key API Query Patterns

```javascript
// Person search by email
const searchResults = await searchEntities({
  "_type.string": "person",
  "email.string": user.value.email,
});

// Task search by group assignment
const taskResponse = await searchEntities({
  "_type.string": "ulesanne",
  "grupp.reference": group._id,
});
```

#### Authentication Flow

1. Middleware checks for `esm_token` and `esm_user` in localStorage
2. Redirects to `/login` if authentication tokens missing
3. Allows access to pupil pages when properly authenticated

#### Group Membership Detection

1. Search for user's person entity by email
2. Retrieve full user profile with `_parent` relationships
3. Filter parent relationships to find group memberships
4. Use group IDs to query assigned tasks

## Technical Details

### File Structure

```text
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pupil-auth.js           # Authentication middleware
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ opilane/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.vue           # Main pupil dashboard
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ulesanne/

â””â”€â”€ composables/
    â””â”€â”€ useEntuApi.js          # Enhanced API integration
```

### Key Dependencies

- **Entu API**: Entity management and data storage
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Reactive state management
- **Nuxt 3**: SSR/SPA framework with middleware support
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive styling and design system
- **Browser Geolocation API**: Location capture functionality

### Data Model Integration

- **Person Entities**: User profiles with email and group relationships
- **Group Entities**: Educational groups for task assignment
- **Task Entities (`ulesanne`)**: Task definitions with group references
- **Response Entities (`vastus`)**: Student submissions linked to tasks and users

## User Experience

### Student Workflow

1. **Login**: Authenticate using existing Entu OAuth system
2. **Dashboard**: View all assigned tasks grouped by status
3. **Task Selection**: Click any task to view detailed requirements
4. **Response Creation**: Submit comprehensive responses with multiple data types
5. **Status Tracking**: Monitor submission status and completion

### Interface Design

- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- **Estonian Language**: Full Estonian language support for educational context
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear navigation patterns with back buttons and breadcrumbs
