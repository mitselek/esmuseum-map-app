# ESMuseum Feature Specifications

This directory contains all feature specifications following our Spec-Driven Development methodology.

## Directory Structure

```text
features/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── F018-feature-name.md         # Individual feature specifications
├── F019-another-feature.md
└── ...
```

## Feature Numbering

- **F001-F017**: Historical features (developed with "old way" methodology)
- **F017**: Constitutional Foundation and Spec-Driven Development adoption
- **F018+**: New features following constitutional Spec-Driven Development

## Workflow Commands

### Create New Feature Specification

```bash
npm run specify "Feature Name"
```

**Example:**

```bash
npm run specify "Enhanced Task Scoring"
# Creates: F018-enhanced-task-scoring.md
```

### Generate Technical Implementation Plan

```bash
npm run plan <feature-number>
```

**Example:**

```bash
npm run plan 18
# Validates F018 specification and guides technical planning
```

### Break Down into Implementation Tasks

```bash
npm run tasks <feature-number>
```

**Example:**

```bash
npm run tasks 18
# Validates technical plan and guides task breakdown
```

## Constitutional Compliance

Every feature specification must demonstrate compliance with all 9 constitutional articles:

1. **Vue 3 Composition API Mandate**
2. **TypeScript-First Development**
3. **Test-Driven Feature Development**
4. **i18n-First User Interface**
5. **Entu API Integration Standards**
6. **Performance-First SPA Architecture**
7. **Component Modularity Principle**
8. **Documentation-Driven Development**
9. **Responsive Design Requirements**

## Quality Gates

### Specification Phase (`/specify`)

- [ ] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain
- [ ] All template placeholders replaced
- [ ] Constitutional compliance documented for all 9 articles
- [ ] Business value clearly articulated
- [ ] User stories validated

### Planning Phase (`/plan`)

- [ ] Technical architecture documented
- [ ] Component structure follows modularity principles
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies documented

### Task Breakdown Phase (`/tasks`)

- [ ] All implementation aspects covered
- [ ] Test-first sequence properly planned
- [ ] Constitutional compliance validation tasks included
- [ ] Parallelization opportunities identified
- [ ] Clear dependencies and priorities

## File Naming Convention

**Format:** `F###-feature-name.md`

- **Feature Number**: Sequential starting from F018
- **Feature Name**: Kebab-case, descriptive but concise
- **Extension**: Always `.md` (Markdown)

**Examples:**

- `F018-enhanced-task-scoring.md`
- `F019-offline-data-sync.md`
- `F020-admin-content-management.md`

## Development Phases

### 1. Specification (`/specify`)

Create comprehensive feature specification with constitutional compliance documentation.

### 2. Planning (`/plan`)

Generate detailed technical implementation plan with architecture review.

### 3. Task Breakdown (`/tasks`)

Transform technical plan into actionable development tasks.

### 4. Implementation

Execute tasks following test-first development and constitutional principles.

## Templates and References

- **Feature Template**: `.copilot-workspace/templates/feature-spec-template.md`
- **Compliance Checklist**: `.copilot-workspace/templates/constitutional-compliance-checklist.md`
- **Workflow Guides**: `.copilot-workspace/workflows/`
- **Constitutional Framework**: `memory/esmuseum-constitution.md`

## Best Practices

### Writing Specifications

1. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague language and assumptions
2. **Measurable Success**: Define clear, testable acceptance criteria
3. **Constitutional Alignment**: Explicitly address all 9 articles
4. **User-Centric**: Focus on end-user value and experience
5. **Phase-Driven**: Break complex features into logical phases

### Technical Planning

1. **Component Modularity**: Respect ≤200 line limit per component
2. **TypeScript First**: Define interfaces before implementation
3. **Test-Driven**: Plan contract tests before code
4. **Performance Aware**: Consider bundle size and Core Web Vitals
5. **Mobile First**: Design for responsive and accessible experience

### Task Organization

1. **Critical Path**: Identify blocking dependencies
2. **Parallel Work**: Group tasks that can run simultaneously
3. **Quality Gates**: Include validation tasks at each phase
4. **Documentation**: Plan docs alongside implementation
5. **Constitutional Validation**: Include compliance verification tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Feature specification template not found"**

- Ensure `.copilot-workspace/templates/feature-spec-template.md` exists
- Run workflow from project root directory

**"Quality gates not satisfied"**

- Resolve all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers
- Replace template placeholders with specific content
- Document compliance for all 9 constitutional articles

**"Planning phase incomplete"**

- Add technical architecture documentation
- Include component structure and API design
- Document risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**"Task breakdown insufficient"**

- Cover all implementation aspects with specific tasks
- Include test-first development sequence
- Add constitutional compliance validation tasks

### Getting Help

1. **Workflow Guides**: Detailed step-by-step instructions in `.copilot-workspace/workflows/`
2. **Constitutional Framework**: Complete architectural principles in `memory/esmuseum-constitution.md`
3. **Template Examples**: Reference completed specifications for patterns
4. **Development Team**: Consult with team members for architecture decisions
