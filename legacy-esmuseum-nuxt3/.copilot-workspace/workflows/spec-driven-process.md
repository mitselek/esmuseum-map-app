**Version**: 1.0  
**Established**: September 19, 2025  
**Authority**: F017 Specification - GitHub Spec Kit Selective Adoption

---

## Overview

This document defines the enhanced Spec-Driven Development workflow that replaces our previous "old way" methodology. Starting with F018, all features must follow this structured approach to ensure constitutional compliance and specification-driven quality.

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 0: Constitutional Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**Purpose**: Establish the foundational framework for all future development

**Deliverables**:

- ✅ ESMuseum Constitution with 9 articles
- ✅ Enhanced feature specification template
- ✅ Constitutional compliance checklists
- ✅ Quality gates documentation

**Validation**: Constitutional framework established and documented

---

### Phase 1: Feature Specification (`/specify`)

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive, unambiguous feature specifications

#### Phase 1 Process Steps

1. **Initialize Feature Documentation**

   ```bash
   # Create new feature specification using template
   cp .copilot-workspace/templates/feature-spec-template.md \
      .copilot-workspace/features/F018-feature-name.md
   ```

2. **Complete Specification Template**

   - Replace all `[placeholder text]` with specific content
   - Define clear business value and success metrics
   - Document comprehensive user stories
   - Specify measurable acceptance criteria

3. **Resolve All Ambiguities**

   - Address all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers
   - Validate assumptions with stakeholders
   - Document explicit decisions for ambiguous requirements

4. **Constitutional Compliance Review**
   - Complete constitutional compliance checklist
   - Document adherence to all 9 articles
   - Justify any exceptions or alternative approaches

#### Phase 1 Quality Gates

- [ ] **Specification Completeness Gate**

  - No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain
  - All placeholder text replaced with specific content
  - Acceptance criteria are measurable and testable

- [ ] **Constitutional Compliance Gate**

  - All 9 constitutional articles reviewed for compliance
  - Compliance explicitly documented for each article
  - Exceptions properly justified

- [ ] **Stakeholder Validation Gate**
  - Business value clearly articulated
  - User stories validated with stakeholders
  - Success metrics agreed upon

**Output**: Complete feature specification ready for technical planning

---

### Phase 2: Technical Planning (`/plan`)

**Purpose**: Generate detailed technical implementation plan with architecture review

#### Phase 2 Process Steps

1. **Architecture Design**

   - Define component structure and boundaries
   - Specify API integration patterns
   - Document state management approach
   - Plan responsive design strategy

2. **Constitutional Architecture Review**

   - Validate Vue 3 Composition API compliance
   - Ensure TypeScript-first approach
   - Confirm component modularity principles
   - Verify performance-first SPA architecture

3. **Technology Selection**

   - Evaluate new dependencies for constitutional compliance
   - Assess performance impact of technology choices
   - Document rationale for architectural decisions

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential implementation challenges
   - Document mitigation strategies
   - Assess impact on existing architecture

#### Phase 2 Quality Gates

- [ ] **Architecture Compliance Gate**

  - Component design follows Article VII modularity principles
  - TypeScript interfaces defined per Article II
  - Performance impact assessed per Article VI

- [ ] **Technical Feasibility Gate**

  - Implementation approach is technically sound
  - Resource requirements are reasonable
  - Dependencies are justified and minimal

- [ ] **Documentation Gate**
  - Technical approach thoroughly documented
  - Architecture decisions recorded
  - Implementation plan is actionable

**Output**: Detailed technical implementation plan with constitutional compliance

---

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown (`/tasks`)

**Purpose**: Break down implementation plan into actionable, parallelizable tasks

#### Phase 3 Process Steps

1. **Task Identification**

   - Derive specific tasks from implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies between tasks
   - Plan task sequencing and parallelization

2. **Test-First Task Planning**

   - Define contract tests for each component/API
   - Plan unit tests for composables and utilities
   - Specify integration tests for component interactions
   - Design E2E tests for user workflows

3. **Constitutional Validation Tasks**

   - Include TypeScript interface creation tasks
   - Plan i18n implementation tasks
   - Add accessibility validation tasks
   - Include performance optimization tasks

4. **Documentation Tasks**
   - Plan code documentation requirements
   - Include user documentation updates
   - Add architectural decision recording

#### Phase 3 Quality Gates

- [ ] **Task Completeness Gate**

  - All implementation aspects covered by tasks
  - Test-first sequence properly planned
  - Documentation tasks included

- [ ] **Parallelization Gate**

  - Independent tasks marked for parallel execution
  - Dependencies clearly identified
  - Critical path optimized

- [ ] **Constitutional Coverage Gate**
  - All constitutional articles addressed in task breakdown
  - Compliance validation tasks included
  - Quality assurance tasks defined

**Output**: Actionable task list ready for implementation

---

### Phase 4: Implementation (`/implement`)

**Purpose**: Execute tasks with constitutional validation gates

#### Phase 4 Process Steps

1. **Pre-Implementation Validation**

   - Verify all quality gates from previous phases
   - Confirm constitutional compliance documentation
   - Validate test strategy and implementation sequence

2. **Test-First Implementation (Article III)**

   ```text
   Contract Tests → Integration Tests → E2E Tests → Unit Tests → Implementation
   ```

3. **Constitutional Compliance During Development**

   - Vue 3 Composition API patterns (Article I)
   - TypeScript-first development (Article II)
   - i18n-first UI implementation (Article IV)
   - Component modularity enforcement (Article VII)
   - Responsive design implementation (Article IX)

4. **Continuous Validation**
   - Run constitutional compliance checks during development
   - Validate test coverage and quality
   - Monitor performance impact
   - Ensure documentation stays current

#### Phase 4 Quality Gates

- [ ] **Implementation Readiness Gate**

  - All previous phase gates satisfied
  - Development environment prepared
  - Implementation sequence validated

- [ ] **Code Quality Gate**

  - TypeScript compliance verified
  - Component modularity maintained
  - Performance benchmarks met

- [ ] **Test Coverage Gate**

  - All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
  - Test coverage meets requirements
  - Contract tests validate interfaces

- [ ] **Constitutional Compliance Gate**
  - All 9 articles compliance verified
  - Quality standards maintained
  - Documentation updated

**Output**: Complete feature implementation with constitutional compliance

## Workflow Automation

### Template Usage

```bash
# Initialize new feature
cp .copilot-workspace/templates/feature-spec-template.md \
   .copilot-workspace/features/F###-feature-name.md

# Use constitutional compliance checklist
# Reference: .copilot-workspace/templates/constitutional-compliance-checklist.md
```

### Quality Gate Automation

Where possible, quality gates are automated through:

- **ESLint Rules**: Constitutional compliance for TypeScript and Vue patterns
- **Type Checking**: Interface coverage validation
- **Test Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Bundle size and performance regression detection

### Manual Validation Requirements

Constitutional compliance requires manual validation for:

- **Architecture Decisions**: Component design and modularity
- **Specification Quality**: Completeness and clarity
- **Test Strategy**: Contract-first approach adequacy
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards compliance

---

## Workflow Comparison

### Old Way (F001-F017)

```text
Idea → Implementation → Documentation → Testing → Review
```

**Issues**:

- Specifications often incomplete or ambiguous
- Architecture decisions made during implementation
- Testing added after implementation
- Constitutional compliance inconsistent

### New Way (F018+)

```text
Constitutional Foundation → /specify → /plan → /tasks → /implement
```

**Benefits**:

- Comprehensive specifications before implementation
- Architecture decisions made with constitutional compliance
- Test-first development enforced
- Quality gates ensure consistency

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures

- **Development Velocity**: Time from specification to completion
- **Specification Quality**: Reduction in clarification questions
