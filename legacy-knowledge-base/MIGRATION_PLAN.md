# üöÄ ESMuseum Spec Kit Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from the current Nuxt 3 implementation to a fresh GitHub Spec Kit-based project while preserving valuable knowledge and code assets.

## Current State Assessment (September 19, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Valuable Assets to Preserve

#### 1. Domain Knowledge & Specifications

- **Location**: `docs/model/` (528KB)
- **Content**:
  - `model.json` - Complete Entu entity model
  - `model.md` - Human-readable specifications
  - `model.yaml` - Structured data model
- **Value**: Critical domain understanding for museums, tasks, locations, responses

#### 2. Business Logic Composables

- **Location**: `app/composables/` (212KB)
- **Key Assets**:
  - `useEntuApi.js` - API integration patterns
  - `useTaskScoring.js` - Scoring algorithm logic
  - `useLocation.js` & `useGeolocation.js` - GPS/mapping logic
  - `useTaskWorkspace.ts` - Task management patterns
  - Authentication modules (modular refactored)
- **Value**: Battle-tested business logic implementation

#### 3. Component Architecture Patterns

- **Location**: `app/components/` (156KB)
- **Key Learnings**:
  - InteractiveMap modular refactoring (just completed)
  - TaskSidebar, TaskFileUpload structures
  - Responsive design patterns
- **Value**: UI/UX patterns and component organization

#### 4. Test Suite & Quality Patterns

- **Location**: `tests/` (136KB)
- **Assets**:
  - Composable test patterns
  - API mocking strategies
  - Integration test approaches
- **Value**: Quality assurance methodology

#### 5. Server-Side Architecture

- **Location**: `server/` (156KB)
- **Assets**:
  - Entu API integration
  - Authentication flows
  - File upload handling
- **Value**: Backend integration patterns

### üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Framework

- **F017 Enhanced Workflow**: Proven development methodology
- **Constitutional Compliance System**: Validation scripts and quality gates
- **Modular Architecture Patterns**: Recently proven with InteractiveMap refactoring

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Knowledge Preservation ‚úÖ (This Phase)

1. **Create Legacy Knowledge Base**
   - Copy current project to `legacy-knowledge-base/`
   - Document key learnings and patterns
   - Extract reusable business logic
   - Preserve domain specifications

### Phase 2: Spec Kit Analysis üîç (Next)

1. **Evaluate GitHub Spec Kit**
   - Review spec-first development approach
   - Assess compatibility with our domain
   - Identify integration opportunities with Entu API
   - Compare with current Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 approach

### Phase 3: Architecture Decision üèóÔ∏è

1. **Decision Matrix**
   - **Option A**: Continue current modular refactoring (lower risk)
   - **Option B**: Fresh Spec Kit start (higher potential, higher risk)
   - **Option C**: Hybrid approach (Spec Kit for new features)

### Phase 4: Implementation üöÄ

- Based on decision, either continue or start fresh
- Systematic migration of valuable business logic
- Preservation of domain knowledge and specifications

## Risk Assessment

### Current Project Continuation Risks

- **Constitutional Debt**: 434 violations remaining
- **Technical Debt**: Legacy patterns and structures
- **Complexity**: Large existing codebase

### Fresh Start Risks

- **Time Investment**: 2-3 months to rebuild core functionality
- **Knowledge Loss**: Risk of losing subtle domain insights
- **Integration Challenges**: Entu API integration complexity

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Gradual Migration**: Phase-by-phase approach
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive documentation
- **Parallel Development**: Keep current working while building new

## Decision Criteria

### Favor Fresh Start If:

- [ ] Spec Kit significantly improves development velocity
- [ ] Current technical debt is too costly to resolve
- [ ] New architecture provides major business value
- [ ] Team capacity allows for 2-3 month rebuild

### Favor Current Continuation If:

- [ ] Current modular refactoring is proving effective
- [ ] Constitutional compliance can be achieved incrementally
- [ ] Business pressure requires faster delivery
- [ ] Risk tolerance is low

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Preserve current state in knowledge base
2. **Research**: Deep dive into GitHub Spec Kit capabilities
3. **Prototype**: Small proof-of-concept with Spec Kit + Entu integration
4. **Decide**: Make informed architectural decision
5. **Execute**: Implement chosen strategy
