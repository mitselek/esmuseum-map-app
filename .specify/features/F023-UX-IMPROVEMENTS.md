**Started**: October 3, 2025  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: User Experience Enhancement

---

## Overview

Systematic improvement of user experience across the application, focusing on usability, clarity, and mobile-first interactions.

---

## üìã Requested Improvements

> **Instructions**: Add improvement requests here with description and rationale.
> Mark with ‚úÖ when approved for implementation.

**Example Format**  

- [ ] **Short Title** - Brief description of the issue and proposed solution
  - **Current behavior**: What happens now
  - **Desired behavior**: What should happen
  - **Impact**: High/Medium/Low
  - **Affected areas**: Components/pages involved

---

## Improvement Requests

### #1: Singular/Plural Grammar for Task Count

- [ ] **Fix Estonian pluralization in task count message**
  - **Current behavior**: Shows "1 √ºlesannet leitud" (incorrect - uses plural form)
  - **Desired behavior**: Show "1 √ºlesanne leitud" (singular) for one task, "N √ºlesannet leitud" (plural) for multiple tasks
  - **Impact**: Low (grammar/polish)
  - **Affected areas**: Task list/search results message
  - **Language**: Estonian only (need to verify if English has similar issue)
  - **i18n key**: `tasksFound` in `.config/i18n.config.ts`

### #2: Date Format Localization in Task List

**Current Behavior:**

- Date format is hardcoded (needs investigation to determine current format)

**Desired Behavior:**

- Follow browser locale for date formatting
- Estonian users: DD.MM.YYYY format
- US users: MM/DD/YYYY format

**Scope:**

- Date format only (not full text localization)

**Impact:** Medium (affects international users)

**Affected Areas:**

- Task list date display

**Questions to Resolve:**

- Which date field specifically? (Task created date, due date, etc.)
- What is the current format implementation?

---

### #3: Make Header Visible on All Pages

**Current Behavior:**

- Header (AppHeader.vue) only visible on auth/callback page
- Login page lacks header - users cannot switch language before seeing auth providers
- Main task page has no app-level header - just TaskSidebar title

**Desired Behavior:**

- Header should be visible consistently across all pages:
  - **Login page**: Header with language switcher (essential for greeting and auth provider selection)
  - **Tasks page**: Header for consistent branding and navigation
  - **Map page**: Header for consistent experience
  - **Auth pages**: Already has header (auth/callback)

**Impact:** Medium (affects navigation consistency and UX, critical for i18n on login)

**Rationale:**

- Login page needs language switcher so users can understand greeting and auth provider labels
- Consistent header across all pages improves branding and navigation

**Affected Areas:**

- app/pages/login/index.vue (add AppHeader)
- app/pages/index.vue (add AppHeader above TaskWorkspace)
- app/components/TaskSidebar.vue (may need layout adjustment)
- Overall app layout structure

**Implementation Notes:**

- AppHeader has: app name, language switcher (üá™üá™üá¨üáßüá∫üá¶), login/logout button, user greeting
- Already works correctly with authenticated/unauthenticated states
- **Main page strategy**: Replace TaskSidebar header with AppHeader
  - Remove "{{ $t('tasks.title') }}" header from TaskSidebar
  - TaskSidebar will start directly with search/filter section
  - Language switcher and logout move to AppHeader
  - Provides consistent navigation across all pages

---

### #4: Remove Icons from Task List

**Current Behavior:**

- Task list items have multiple SVG icons decorating information:
  - üîç Search icon in search input field
  - üì¶ Group icon (expand/arrows) next to group name
  - üí¨ Chat bubble icon next to response count
  - üìÖ Calendar icon next to due date
  - üîµ Blue dot indicator for selected task

**Desired Behavior:**

- Remove decorative icons from task list items
- **Keep**: üîç Search icon in input field (legitimate UX pattern)
- **Remove**: üì¶ Group icon, üí¨ Response count icon, üìÖ Due date icon
- **Remove**: üîµ Blue dot selected indicator + its logic (unnecessary - when task is selected, user is not on task list page)

**Impact:** Low-Medium (visual simplification, reduced clutter)

**Rationale:**

- Icons add visual noise without adding clarity
- Text labels are already clear and self-explanatory
- Simpler, cleaner design is more professional
- Selected indicator is redundant - user navigates away from task list when selecting

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskSidebar.vue:
  - Lines ~163-175: Remove group icon SVG
  - Lines ~183-195: Remove response count icon SVG
  - Lines ~207-219: Remove due date icon SVG
  - Lines ~225-235: Remove selected indicator div and logic
- Adjust spacing/margins after icon removal for proper text alignment

**Implementation Notes:**

- Keep search icon (lines 19-30) - standard UX pattern
- Remove SVG elements but keep the text labels
- May need to adjust `mr-1` (margin-right) classes that were spacing icons from text
- Remove `selectedTaskId` comparison logic for blue dot indicator

---

### #5: Move Green Checkmark to Front of Response Stats

**Current Behavior:**

- Green checkmark (‚úì) appears on the right side, next to task title (lines 135-147)
- Response stats (e.g., "2 / 1 vastust") appear below with chat bubble icon (lines 182-198)
- Layout: Title with checkmark on right, then description, then group, then stats below

**Desired Behavior:**

- Move green checkmark to the left/front of response stats (n/m format)
- Visual hierarchy: Stats line should show checkmark first, then "2 / 1 vastust"
- Checkmark indicates task completion more clearly when positioned with completion stats

**Impact:** Low (visual reorganization, improved semantic positioning)

**Rationale:**

- Checkmark next to completion stats is more semantically clear
- "Task is complete" indicator belongs with "completion count" information
- Better visual association between checkmark and progress numbers

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskSidebar.vue:
  - Lines 135-147: Remove checkmark SVG from title section
  - Lines 182-198: Add checkmark before response stats text
  - Adjust flex/spacing to accommodate checkmark in stats line

**Implementation Notes:**

- Current checkmark: `class="ml-2 size-5 shrink-0 text-green-600"`
- Move to response stats div (line 182)
- Should appear before the stats text, possibly smaller size to fit inline
- Keep `v-if="isTaskFullyCompleted(task._id)"` condition
- Consider reducing size from `size-5` to `size-4` or `size-3` to match stats text scale

---

### #6: Add "Open" Button to Each Task Card

**Current Behavior:**

- Task cards are fully clickable (entire card triggers navigation)
- No explicit visual button to open/view task details
- Click handler: `@click="navigateToTask(task._id)"` on entire card div (line 127)

**Desired Behavior:**

- Add an "Avada" (Open) button on the right side of each task card
- Button should be clearly visible and actionable
- Clicking button navigates to task detail view
- Card may remain clickable OR only button triggers navigation (to be decided)

**Impact:** Medium (improves UX clarity and accessibility)

**Rationale:**

- Explicit button makes interaction clearer - users know where to click
- "Open" action is more discoverable than clicking entire card
- Better mobile UX - clear tap target
- Follows common UI patterns (list items with action buttons)

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskSidebar.vue:
  - Lines 129-147: Task title row with checkmark
  - Add button in title row, top right position
  - Keep `@click="navigateToTask(task._id)"` on card (whole card remains clickable)
  - Button needs `@click.stop` to prevent double navigation
- .config/i18n.config.ts:
  - Add translation key `tasks.open`:
    - Estonian: "Avada ‚Üí"
    - English: "Open ‚Üí"
    - Ukrainian: "–í—ñ–¥–∫—Ä–∏—Ç–∏ ‚Üí"

**Implementation Details:**

- **Position**: Top right in title row (line ~130)
- **Card behavior**: Entire card remains clickable (both card AND button work)
- **Button style**: Text button with arrow from i18n (arrow included in translation)
- **i18n key**: `tasks.open` (includes "‚Üí" arrow in all translations)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Place button in title row: `<div class="mb-2 flex items-start justify-between">`
- Button should replace or coexist with checkmark position
- Use `@click.stop="navigateToTask(task._id)"` to prevent event bubbling
- Button text: Simply use `{{ $t('tasks.open') }}` - arrow is part of the translation
- No need for separate arrow icon - Unicode "‚Üí" included in i18n strings
- Button styling suggestions:
  - Small, unobtrusive: `text-xs text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800`
  - Or subtle button: `text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded hover:bg-blue-50`
- Ensure button has proper focus/hover states for accessibility
- Completed tasks (opacity-60) should also have visible button

---

### #7: Remove Rounded Corners from Map

**Current Behavior:**

- InteractiveMap component has rounded corners: `rounded-lg` class (line 2)
- Map container: `class="h-64 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-gray-100"`
- Creates visual gap between map and surrounding content

**Desired Behavior:**

- Remove `rounded-lg` class from map container
- Map should have sharp, square corners
- Flush integration with surrounding UI elements

**Impact:** Low (visual refinement, cleaner design)

**Rationale:**

- Rounded corners on maps are unnecessary decoration
- Square corners provide more professional, modern look
- Better visual integration with task detail panel layout
- Maximizes map viewing area

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/InteractiveMap.vue:
  - Line 2: Remove `rounded-lg` from container div class
  - Keep other classes: `h-64 w-full overflow-hidden border border-gray-200 bg-gray-100`

**Implementation Notes:**

- Simple one-word removal: delete `rounded-lg`
- Keep `overflow-hidden` to ensure map doesn't bleed outside container
- Keep border and background for visual definition
- No other changes needed

---

### #8: Reorganize Task Detail Header Layout

**Current Behavior:**

- TaskWorkspaceHeader shows:
  - **Left side**: Progress count "2 / 1" + Close button (X)
  - **Right side**: Language flags (üá¨üáßüá∫üá¶) + Logout button
- No task title visible in header
- Progress count takes prominent left position

**Desired Behavior:**

- New header layout (left to right):
  1. **Back button** (arrow or similar) - to return to task list
  2. **Task title** - show current task name prominently
  3. **Language switcher** - flag buttons (üá™üá™üá¨üáßüá∫üá¶)
  4. **Logout button** - user logout action

**Impact:** Medium (improves navigation and context clarity)

**Rationale:**

- Task title provides context - users should always see which task they're viewing
- Back button is more intuitive than close (X) for returning to list
- Standard header pattern: Navigation (back) ‚Üí Content (title) ‚Üí Actions (language/logout)
- Progress count can move elsewhere or be removed (already shown in task card)

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskWorkspaceHeader.vue:
  - Lines 3-30: Left side - replace progress + close with back button + title
  - Lines 32-67: Right side - keep languages + logout (already correct)
  - Props: Add `taskTitle` prop, remove `progress` prop (moves elsewhere)
  - Change `@close` emit to `@back` emit
- app/components/TaskDetailPanel.vue:
  - Line 12-14: Update TaskWorkspaceHeader props
  - Pass task title from selectedTask
  - Update close handler to back handler
  - Progress display moves to TaskMapCard area (see improvement #9)
- .config/i18n.config.ts:
  - Add translation key `tasks.close`:
    - Estonian: "‚Üê Tagasi"
    - English: "‚Üê Back"
    - Ukrainian: "‚Üê –ù–∞–∑–∞–¥"

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Progress count (2/1)**: Moves under the map (to be addressed in next improvement #9)
2. **Back button style**: Arrow + text from i18n (arrow included in translation)
3. **Task title**: Truncate with ellipsis if too long
4. **i18n key**: `tasks.close` (includes "‚Üê" arrow in all translations)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Back button: Simply use `{{ $t('tasks.close') }}` - arrow is part of the translation
- No need for separate arrow icon - Unicode "‚Üê" included in i18n strings
- Task title prop: `:task-title="selectedTask?.pealkiri?.[0]?.string || ''"`
- Title should use `truncate` or `line-clamp-1` class for overflow
- Keep language switcher and logout button as-is (already working)
- Remove `progress` prop from TaskWorkspaceHeader component
- Emit `@back` instead of `@close` for semantic clarity
- Mobile: Title truncates first, back button remains visible

---

### #9: Add Progress and Deadline Below Map

**Current Behavior:**

- TaskWorkspaceHeader shows progress "2 / 1" in header (to be removed in #8)
- TaskHeader.vue component shows task info below map area:
  - Title, description, group name, response progress
  - Located in separate component (lines 1-78)
- No dedicated progress + deadline row directly below map

**Desired Behavior:**

- Add a new info row directly below the map (above manual location override section)
- Layout: **First row** with progress and deadline side by side:
  - Left: Progress indicator "2 / 1" or similar format
  - Right: Deadline date (if task has deadline)
- **Followed by**: Task description text below

**Impact:** Medium (improves information hierarchy and visibility)

**Rationale:**

- Progress should be visible near the map area for context
- Deadline is critical information that should be prominent
- First row with key metrics, then description creates clear hierarchy
- Removes need for progress in header (cleaner header layout)

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskMapCard.vue:
  - After InteractiveMap component (after line 12)
  - Before "Manual Location Override" section (before line 14)
  - Add new section with progress + deadline row
  - Then description text immediately below
  - Add props: `progress`, `deadline`, `description`
- app/components/TaskDetailPanel.vue:
  - Pass progress data to TaskMapCard
  - Pass deadline and description to TaskMapCard
  - Update TaskMapCard props binding
- app/components/TaskWorkspaceHeader.vue:
  - Remove progress display (handled in #8)
- Date formatting:
  - All dates should use common locale-aware formatting
  - Respects browser locale (DD.MM.YYYY for Estonian, MM/DD/YYYY for US, etc.)
  - Related to improvement #2 (date format localization)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Progress format**: "2 / 1" (compact, no label)
2. **Deadline display**: Just the date, respecting locale (no icon, no label)
3. **Section styling**: Plain text, no background or border
4. **Description placement**: Right below progress/deadline row, above manual location section

**Implementation Notes:**

- Insert new section in TaskMapCard.vue between map and manual location override
- Layout structure:

  ```text
  [InteractiveMap]
  <div> Progress: "2 / 1" (left) | Deadline: "19.09.2025" (right) </div>
  <div> Description text </div>
  [Manual Location Override section]
  ```

- Progress data already available in TaskDetailPanel (line 98): `{ actual, expected }`
- Deadline: Extract from `selectedTask.t√§htaeg` or `selectedTask.deadline`
- Description: Extract from `selectedTask.kirjeldus` or use `getTaskDescription()` helper
- **Date formatting**: Create/use common date formatter utility that respects locale
  - Should be consistent across all date displays (relates to #2)
  - Use browser's `Intl.DateTimeFormat` or similar
  - Format should match user's locale preference
- Responsive: Keep side-by-side on all screens (progress and deadline are short)
- No special styling - plain text for minimal, clean look

---

### #10: Show Response Form Only When Location Selected

**Current Behavior:**

- TaskResponseForm shows all fields immediately:
  - Location picker (if needsLocation is true)
  - Text response textarea (TaskResponseTextarea)
  - File upload component (TaskFileUpload)
  - Submit button
- User can see and interact with response fields before selecting a location

**Desired Behavior:**

- Response fields (textarea and file upload) should be hidden until location is selected
- Flow:
  1. User sees location picker first
  2. After selecting location ‚Üí response textarea and file upload appear
  3. User can then fill in response and upload files
- Submit button also appears only after location selected

**Impact:** Medium (improves UX flow and reduces confusion)

**Rationale:**

- Prevents users from filling in responses before selecting required location
- Creates clear step-by-step flow: location first, then response
- Reduces cognitive load - one task at a time
- Prevents frustration of filling form then realizing location wasn't selected

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskResponseForm.vue:
  - Lines 40-50: TaskResponseTextarea and TaskFileUpload components
  - Wrap these in conditional rendering based on location selection
  - Submit button also conditional
  - Location picker always visible (if needsLocation)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Add condition: `v-if="!needsLocation || selectedLocation"`
- Logic: Show response fields if:
  - Task doesn't need location (`!needsLocation`), OR
  - Location is selected (`selectedLocation` is truthy)
- Applies to:
  - TaskResponseTextarea component
  - TaskFileUpload component
  - Submit button
- Location picker remains visible until location selected
- Clear visual progression: location ‚Üí response ‚Üí submit

---

### #11: Remove Manual Location Override Feature

**Current Behavior:**

- TaskMapCard.vue includes "Manual Location Override" section (lines 14-97):
  - UI for entering coordinates manually (lat, lng format)
  - "Enter Manually" / "Cancel" buttons
  - Input field with format validation
  - "Apply Location" and "Clear Override" buttons
  - Amber alert box when manual override is active
- Complex functionality:
  - `showManualCoordinates`, `manualCoordinates`, `hasManualOverride` state
  - `effectiveUserPosition` computed property merging GPS and manual input
  - Coordinate validation logic
  - Integration with `useLocation()` composable (`setManualOverride`)
  - Event emission to parent (`location-change`)
  - Watch on `hasManualOverride` to control GPS updates
- i18n keys used (lines 18-47 in TaskMapCard template):
  - `taskDetail.manualLocationOverride`
  - `taskDetail.enterManually`
  - `taskDetail.cancel`
  - `taskDetail.coordinatesFormat`
  - `taskDetail.coordinatesExample`
  - `taskDetail.manualLocationHelp`
  - `taskDetail.applyLocation`
  - `taskDetail.clearOverride`
  - `taskDetail.manualLocationActive`
  - `taskDetail.remove`
- Duplicate component exists: `TaskLocationOverride.vue` (noted in docs/OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md)

**Desired Behavior:**

- Remove entire manual location override section and functionality
- Use only GPS-based user position
- Simplify TaskMapCard to focus on map display only
- Remove related code duplication

**Impact:** Medium-High (significant code removal, simplifies UX and codebase)

**Rationale:**

- Feature adds complexity without clear user benefit
- Users should rely on GPS for accurate location
- Manual coordinate entry is error-prone and confusing
- Simplifies maintenance and testing
- Removes code duplication between TaskMapCard and TaskLocationOverride components

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskMapCard.vue:
  - Lines 14-97: Remove entire manual override template section
  - Lines 160-230: Remove manual override script logic:
    - `showManualCoordinates`, `manualCoordinates`, `hasManualOverride` refs
    - `effectiveUserPosition` computed (use `userPosition` prop directly)
    - `isValidCoordinates()`, `applyManualLocation()`, `clearManualLocation()`, `cancelManualEntry()`, `startManualEntry()` functions
    - Watch on `hasManualOverride`
    - Remove `setManualOverride` from useLocation composable call
  - Remove `location-change` emit from Emits interface
- app/components/TaskDetailPanel.vue:
  - Remove `@location-change="handleLocationOverride"` event handler
  - Remove `handleLocationOverride` function
- app/composables/useLocation.ts:
  - Remove `setManualOverride` function (if it exists)
  - Remove any manual override tracking state
- app/components/TaskLocationOverride.vue:
  - Delete this duplicate component entirely
- .config/i18n.config.ts:
  - Can optionally remove unused manual override i18n keys (cleanup, not required)

**Implementation Complexity:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a complex removal task** involving:

1. Template removal (straightforward)
2. Script logic cleanup (moderate - multiple functions and state)
3. Parent component integration changes (event handlers)
4. Composable cleanup (needs investigation)
5. Component deletion (TaskLocationOverride.vue)
6. Testing to ensure GPS-only flow works correctly

**Implementation Notes:**

- Replace all uses of `effectiveUserPosition` with `props.userPosition`
- Remove the manual override UI section entirely (lines 14-97)
- Clean up parent component event handlers
- Test GPS-only functionality thoroughly
- Consider keeping i18n keys initially (for safety) and remove in cleanup phase
- Delete TaskLocationOverride.vue component (duplicate)
- Update any documentation referencing manual override feature

---

### #12: Remove "GPS sorted" Message Above Location List

**Current Behavior:**

- LocationPicker.vue shows "üìç GPS sorted" message (line 80)
- Appears in top right corner above location list
- Shows when user position is available and locations are sorted by distance
- Conditional display: `v-else-if="userPosition"`

**Desired Behavior:**

- Remove the "üìç GPS sorted" message completely
- Keep the "Searching for GPS..." message when GPS is loading
- Location list remains sorted by distance (functionality unchanged)
- Cleaner, less cluttered header

**Impact:** Low (simple visual cleanup)

**Rationale:**

- Message is unnecessary - users don't need to know sorting method
- Distance text on each location already indicates GPS sorting
- Reduces visual clutter
- Sorting by distance is the expected default behavior

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/LocationPicker.vue:
  - Lines 75-81: Remove the entire `<span v-else-if="userPosition">` block
  - Keep the "Searching for GPS..." message (lines 70-74)
  - Location sorting logic remains unchanged (lines 249-257)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Simple template removal - delete lines 75-81:

  ```vue
  <span v-else-if="userPosition" class="text-xs text-green-600">
    üìç GPS sorted
  </span>
  ```

- Keep the loading message: "{{ t('taskDetail.searchingLocationGPS') }}"
- No script changes needed
- No i18n cleanup needed (no dedicated key, just plain text)

---

### #13: Fixed Header and Map with Scrollable Content Below

**Current Behavior:**

- TaskDetailPanel.vue layout (lines 1-52):
  - Header: TaskWorkspaceHeader (fixed at top)
  - Content area: `<div class="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">` (line 18)
  - Everything scrolls together: map, location list, and response form
  - When user scrolls down, map disappears from view
- Current structure:

  ```text
  [Header - Fixed]
  [Content - Scrollable]
    - Map
    - Location Picker (opened list or selected location)
    - Response Form (text input + file upload)
  ```

**Desired Behavior:**

- Split fixed and scrollable areas:

  ```text
  [Header - FIXED at top]
  [Map - FIXED below header]
  [Scrollable Content Area]
    - Progress + Deadline + Description (from #9)
    - Location Picker:
      * If no location selected: opened list of locations
      * If location selected: collapsed to show selected location only
    - Response Form (text input + file upload, shown after location selected per #10)
  ```

- Header and map always visible when scrolling
- Only content below map scrolls
- Provides constant context (header + map) while working with locations and responses

**Impact:** High (major layout change, significantly improves UX)

**Rationale:**

- Map provides critical context for location selection - should always be visible
- Header provides navigation (back button) and task title - always needed
- Scrolling through locations while seeing map helps spatial understanding
- Reduces need to scroll back up to see map
- Better mobile experience - map remains as reference point

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskDetailPanel.vue:
  - Lines 10-52: Restructure layout to separate fixed and scrollable areas
  - Header remains fixed (already is via TaskWorkspaceHeader)
  - Map becomes fixed section
  - New scrollable container for everything below map
- app/components/TaskMapCard.vue:
  - May need height adjustments to fit in fixed area
  - Progress/deadline/description section (from #9) moves outside TaskMapCard
- app/components/TaskResponseForm.vue:
  - No changes needed, just container layout change
- CSS/Tailwind classes:
  - Careful height management: `h-screen`, `h-[300px]`, `flex-1`, `overflow-y-auto`

**Layout Structure:**

```vue
<div class="flex h-full flex-col">
  <!-- Fixed Header -->
  <TaskWorkspaceHeader ... />
  
  <!-- Fixed Map -->
  <div class="shrink-0">
    <InteractiveMap ... />
    <!-- Progress + Deadline + Description (from #9) -->
  </div>
  
  <!-- Scrollable Content -->
  <div class="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
    <LocationPicker ... />
    <TaskResponseForm ... />
  </div>
</div>
```

**Implementation Complexity:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium-High complexity**:

1. Restructure TaskDetailPanel layout hierarchy
2. Separate map from scrollable content
3. Height calculations for fixed map area
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness
5. Coordinate with #9 (progress/deadline below map)
6. Test scrolling behavior on different screen sizes

**Implementation Notes:**

- Header already fixed via TaskWorkspaceHeader positioning
- **Map height**: Use viewport-relative height: `h-[30vh]` (30% of viewport height)
- Map section: `class="shrink-0 h-[30vh]"` for fixed positioning
- Scrollable area: `class="flex-1 overflow-y-auto"`
- Progress/deadline/description moves from TaskMapCard to between map and scrollable area
- LocationPicker and TaskResponseForm go inside scrollable container
- **Mobile behavior**: Same layout on all screen sizes (map always fixed at top)
- InteractiveMap component may need height adjustment to fill container
- Test with: long location lists, long descriptions, various mobile screens
- Ensure map is responsive within the 30vh constraint

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Map height**: 30vh (30% of viewport height)
2. **Mobile behavior**: Keep same layout (map always fixed at top)
3. **Layout structure**:

   ```vue
   <div class="flex h-full flex-col">
     <TaskWorkspaceHeader />
     <div class="shrink-0 h-[30vh]">
       <InteractiveMap class="h-full" />
       <!-- Progress/deadline/description -->
     </div>
     <div class="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
       <LocationPicker />
       <TaskResponseForm />
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

### #14: Replace Page Reload with Optimistic Updates After Response Submission

**Current Behavior:**

- TaskDetailPanel.vue `handleResponseSubmitted()` (lines 207-212):

  ```javascript
  const handleResponseSubmitted = (_responseData: unknown): void => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      window.location.reload()
    }, 500)
  }
  ```

- After response submission:
  1. 500ms delay
  2. Full page reload (`window.location.reload()`)
  3. Entire app reloads: map flashes, state resets, all data re-fetched
- Poor UX: flickering, loss of context, unnecessary work

**Desired Behavior:**

- After response submission:
  1. **Show success overlay** with submitted data summary
  2. **Fetch new response entity** from API
  3. **Update local state** optimistically:
     - Add new response to existing responses list
     - Update response counts (actual/expected)
     - Update task completion status
     - Update any "completed tasks" indicators
  4. **Keep current view** - no reload, no flashing
  5. User can continue working or go back seamlessly

**Impact:** High (major UX improvement, performance boost, better state management)

**Rationale:**

- **Eliminates page reload**: No flickering, no loss of context
- **Faster feedback**: Immediate visual confirmation
- **Better UX**: Smooth, modern app behavior
- **Reduces server load**: Only fetch new response entity, not everything
- **Maintains state**: Map position, scroll position, other tasks in memory
- **Professional feel**: SPA behavior, not multi-page app

**Affected Areas:**

- app/components/TaskDetailPanel.vue:
  - Lines 207-212: Replace `handleResponseSubmitted` with optimistic update logic
  - Fetch new response entity from API
  - Update local state: responses, counts, completion status
  - Trigger UI updates without reload
- app/components/TaskResponseForm.vue:
  - Lines 277-280: Already emits 'response-submitted' with data
  - May need to emit response entity ID for fetching
  - Form should reset after successful submission
- app/composables/useCompletedTasks.ts:
  - Update completed tasks cache with new response
  - Recalculate task completion status
  - Update stats: actual/expected counts
- app/composables/useTaskWorkspace.ts:
  - May need method to update single task's response count
  - Update task list display if showing counts
- UI Components:
  - Create success overlay/modal component
  - Show submitted data summary
  - Allow user to dismiss and continue

**Success Overlay Content:**

- ‚úÖ Success indicator
- Submitted text response
- Uploaded file names (if any)
- Selected location name
- Response count update ("2 of 3 responses submitted")
- "Continue" or "Close" button

**Data Flow:**

1. User submits response
2. TaskResponseForm creates response entity (already done)
3. TaskResponseForm uploads files (already done)
4. TaskResponseForm emits 'response-submitted' with response ID
5. TaskDetailPanel receives event:
   - Show success overlay with submitted data
   - Fetch full response entity: `GET /api/responses/{id}`
   - Update useCompletedTasks cache
   - Update task stats (actual/expected)
   - Update UI: response count, completion checkmark
   - Reset form state
6. User dismisses overlay, continues working

**Implementation Complexity:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **High complexity**:

1. Replace reload with state management
2. Create success overlay component
3. Fetch and integrate new response entity
4. Update multiple composables (useCompletedTasks, useTaskWorkspace)
5. Handle edge cases (submission fails, concurrent submissions)
6. Ensure all UI elements update correctly
7. Test thoroughly: counts, checkmarks, task list

**Implementation Notes:**

- Remove `window.location.reload()` entirely
- Create `SubmissionSuccessOverlay.vue` component
- API endpoint needed: `GET /api/responses/{responseId}` (if not exists)
- Update `useCompletedTasks` with method: `addResponse(taskId, responseEntity)`
- Update response counts in real-time
- Handle form reset: clear text, files, location selection
- Consider animation/transition for overlay
- Error handling: if fetch fails, show error but don't reload
- Maintain task list sorting if based on completion status

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Overlay design**: Modal dialog (centered, requires user action)
2. **Overlay duration**: Manual close only - user chooses next action
3. **Form reset**: Reset immediately after showing "Submitting..." state
4. **Navigation**: Show options - "Submit another response" or "‚Üê Back to tasks"

**Submission Flow:**

1. **User presses submit button**
2. **Open modal overlay** showing:
   - "Submitting..." indicator
   - Preview of submitted content:
     - Text response
     - File names (if any)
     - Selected location name
3. **Reset form immediately** (clear text, files, location)
4. **Receive submission status from Entu**:
   - Update overlay with status (success/error)
5. **On success**:
   - Fetch fresh response entity back from API
   - Update overlay with saved values from entity
   - Update local state (counts, completion status)
   - Show action buttons:
     - "Submit another response" (stay on task, form already reset)
     - "‚Üê Back to tasks" (navigate to task list)
6. **On error**:
   - Show error message in overlay
   - Option to "Try again" or "Close"
   - Don't reload page

**Modal Overlay States:**

1. **Submitting**: Spinner + "Submitting your response..."
2. **Success**: ‚úÖ + "Response submitted successfully!" + saved data + action buttons
3. **Error**: ‚ùå + Error message + "Try again" / "Close" buttons

**Implementation Notes:**

- Create `ResponseSubmissionModal.vue` component
- Modal props: `open`, `state` (submitting/success/error), `responseData`, `savedEntity`
- Modal emits: `@close`, `@submit-another`, `@back-to-tasks`
- Form reset happens immediately when overlay opens
- Fetch response entity: `GET /api/responses/{id}` or from submission response
- Update useCompletedTasks cache before showing success state
- Navigation handled by parent (TaskDetailPanel)
