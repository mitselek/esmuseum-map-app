# Feature F020: Automated Student Access Management via Webhooks

## Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

## Overview

Automatically grant student access permissions when students are added to classes or tasks are assigned to classes. This eliminates manual permission management and ensures students can immediately access and respond to assigned tasks.

**Key Achievement:** Uses JWT tokens from Entu webhooks for proper user attribution - each permission grant is attributed to the user who triggered the action!

## Problem Statement

When a new student (`person`) is added to a class (`grupp`) OR a task (`ulesanne`) is assigned to a class, students need `_expander` permission on the task entity to create responses (`vastus`) as child entities.

Previously this required manual permission management. Now it's fully automated.

## Solution

Two webhook endpoints that Entu calls automatically:

1. **Student Added to Class**: Grant student access to all tasks assigned to that class
2. **Task Assigned to Class**: Grant all class members access to that task

**Authentication:** Uses JWT tokens from Entu webhook payload - each action is properly attributed to the initiating user.

**Key Benefits:**

- âœ… Proper user attribution in audit logs
- âœ… No need for privileged admin API key
- âœ… Actions scoped to user permissions (principle of least privilege)
- âœ… Better security and compliance
- âœ… Per-entity queue system prevents duplicate work
- âœ… Bulk permission granting (1 API call per entity vs N per person)

## Data Model

### Entity Relationships

```text
person (student)
  â””â”€ _parent â†’ grupp (class)
       â””â”€ referenced by â†’ ulesanne.grupp (task assignment)
            â””â”€ needs _expander permission â†’ to create â†’ vastus (response)
```

### Permission Model

**`_expander` Permission**

- Allows entity to create child entities under the target entity
- Students need `_expander` on `ulesanne` to create `vastus` responses
- Granted automatically by webhooks

---

## Implementation

### Webhook Payload Format

Entu sends webhooks in this format:

```json
{
  "db": "esmuuseum",
  "plugin": "entity-edit-webhook",
  "entity": { "_id": "66b6245c7efc9ac06a437b97" },
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

The JWT token contains:

```json
{
  "user": { "email": "user@example.com" },
  "accounts": { "esmuuseum": "user_id" },
  "iat": 1759405472,
  "exp": 1759405532
}
```

**Token Validity:** Currently 60 seconds. Requesting Entu extend to **10 minutes** for reliable processing.

### Webhook Endpoints

#### 1. POST /api/webhooks/student-added-to-class

**Trigger:** Entu webhook when `person` entity is edited (student added to class)

**Logic:**

1. Extract JWT token from webhook â†’ get user email/ID
2. Check webhook queue - debounce if same entity already processing
3. Fetch full entity details from Entu API (using user's token)
4. For each parent group (`_parent` references):
   - Query all tasks (`ulesanne`) assigned to that group
   - Grant `_expander` permission using user's JWT token (skip if exists)
5. Check if entity was re-edited during processing â†’ reprocess if needed
6. Return success response with stats

**Queue Strategy:** Per-entity debouncing ensures final state synced without duplicate work. If same entity edited while processing, marks for reprocessing after 2-second delay.

#### 2. POST /api/webhooks/task-assigned-to-class

**Trigger:** Entu webhook when `ulesanne` entity is edited (task assigned to class)

**Logic:**

1. Extract JWT token from webhook â†’ get user email/ID
2. Check webhook queue - debounce if same entity already processing
3. Fetch full entity details from Entu API (using user's token)
4. Query all students (`person`) in that group (where `_parent` references group)
5. **Bulk grant** `_expander` permissions (1 API call total!)
6. Check if entity was re-edited â†’ reprocess if needed
7. Return success response with stats

**Performance:** Uses bulk permission API - grants all permissions in a single API call rather than one per student.

### Cloudflare Tunnel for Local Testing

To receive webhooks during development:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Configure Entu webhooks with your tunnel URL:

- `https://your-tunnel.trycloudflare.com/api/webhooks/student-added-to-class`
- `https://your-tunnel.trycloudflare.com/api/webhooks/task-assigned-to-class`

## Key Features

### 1. User Attribution

Every permission grant is properly attributed to the user who triggered the action:

```log
[INFO] Webhook initiated by user {
  userId: '66b6245c7efc9ac06a437ba0',
  userEmail: '37204030303@eesti.ee'
}
```

Entu's audit log shows the actual user (not a system account) made the change.

### 2. Queue System

Per-entity queuing prevents duplicate work:

- If webhook for entity A arrives while A is processing â†’ mark for reprocess
- After processing completes, wait 2 seconds
- Reprocess if marked (ensures final state is synced)
- Different entities process in parallel

### 3. Bulk Permissions

Task assignment uses bulk permission API:

- Old approach: N API calls (one per student)
- New approach: 1 API call (all students at once)
- Massive performance improvement for large classes

### 4. Idempotency

Safe to call multiple times:

- Checks if permission already exists before granting
- Skips duplicate permissions
- Returns success even if permission already granted

## Testing & Verification

### Success Indicators

âœ… User token extracted and used for all API calls
âœ… Clear log showing user email who initiated action  
âœ… Permissions granted successfully
âœ… Processing completes in < 2 seconds (typically ~800ms)
âœ… No errors or warnings

### Example Log Output

```log
[INFO] Webhook received: student-added-to-class
[INFO] Extracted user token from webhook { userId: '...', userEmail: '...' }
[INFO] Webhook initiated by user { userId: '...', userEmail: '...' }
[INFO] Processing student webhook { entityId: '...', userEmail: '...', initiatedBy: '...' }
[INFO] Found groups for person...
[INFO] Found tasks for person's groups...
[INFO] Starting batch permission grant...
[INFO] Batch permission grant completed { successful: 3, skipped: 2 }
[INFO] Webhook processing completed { success: true, duration: ~800ms }
```

### Testing Steps

1. **Trigger webhook** - Add student to class or assign task to class in Entu
2. **Check logs** - Verify user token extraction and attribution
3. **Verify permissions** - Check Entu to confirm permissions granted
4. **Check audit log** - Verify actions attributed to correct user

## JWT Token Authentication Journey

### The Challenge We Solved

When implementing F020, we initially faced a significant challenge with Entu's webhook JWT tokens.

**Initial Problem (RESOLVED):**

When testing user JWT tokens, we encountered `401 jwt audience invalid. expected: 82.131.122.238` errors:

1. User edited entity in Entu from their IP address (e.g., 82.131.122.238)
2. Entu generated JWT token and sent webhook to our server
3. Our webhook server (different IP) tried to use the token for API calls
4. Entu rejected with "jwt audience invalid" - expecting requests from the user's original IP
5. This was Entu's server-side security feature to prevent token theft/replay attacks

**Why It Happened:**

- JWT token itself had **no `aud` (audience) claim**
- Entu validated source IP server-side against the IP that generated the token
- Webhook servers have different IPs than end users
- Security feature prevented our legitimate server-side usage

**Temporary Workaround:**

We implemented a hybrid approach:

- Extract user email/ID from JWT token (for attribution logging)
- Use admin API key for actual API calls
- Our logs showed real user, but Entu's logs showed admin account

**Resolution by Entu:**

ðŸŽ‰ **Entu removed the IP validation for webhook tokens!**

This enabled the proper implementation we have today:

- Use JWT tokens from webhooks directly
- Each API call attributed to the real user
- No admin API key needed
- Perfect audit trail in both our logs and Entu's logs

### Current Implementation

**Token Format:**

```json
{
  "user": { "email": "user@example.com" },
  "accounts": { "esmuuseum": "user_id" },
  "iat": 1759405472,
  "exp": 1759405532
}
```

**Token Flow:**

1. User edits entity in Entu â†’ webhook triggered
2. Webhook payload includes JWT token
3. We extract token with `extractUserToken()`
4. Pass token to all API calls
5. Entu logs show real user performed actions âœ…

**Key Code:**

```typescript
// Extract from webhook
const { token, userId, userEmail } = extractUserToken(payload);

// Use for all API calls
await batchGrantPermissions(taskIds, studentIds, token, userId, userEmail);
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start with proper attribution** - Don't assume system accounts are sufficient
2. **Communicate with API providers** - Entu was responsive to the IP validation issue
3. **Plan for token expiry** - 60-second tokens can expire during processing
4. **Log extensively** - Helped us understand the IP validation behavior
5. **Build fallbacks carefully** - Hybrid approach kept us operational during the fix

## Architecture Decisions

### Why User Tokens Instead of Admin Key?

**Security:**

- Admin key has full privileges - if compromised, attacker has complete access
- User tokens are scoped - if user loses admin rights, webhooks stop working
- Follows principle of least privilege

**Attribution:**

- Admin key: All actions appear as system account
- User tokens: Each action shows the real person who triggered it
- Better audit trail for compliance

**Compliance:**

- Some regulations require knowing who performed each action
- User attribution provides this automatically
- No ambiguity about responsibility

### Why Queue System?

**Problem:** User might edit entity multiple times quickly (e.g., add multiple groups)

**Solution:** Queue with debouncing

- First webhook starts processing
- Second webhook arrives â†’ marks for reprocess
- First processing completes
- System waits 2 seconds (allows more edits)
- Reprocesses with final state

**Result:** Efficient processing without missing updates

### Why Bulk Permissions?

**Performance:**

- 30-student class: 1 API call vs 30 API calls
- Faster processing (< 1 second vs several seconds)
- Less load on Entu API

**Reliability:**

- Fewer API calls = fewer potential failures
- Atomic operation (all or nothing)

---

## Known Issues & Future Work

### Token Validity

**Current:** JWT tokens expire after 60 seconds

**Issue:** If webhook processing takes > 60s, token expires mid-process

**Solution:** Requesting Entu extend token validity to **10 minutes**

**Workaround:** If token expires, webhook fails with clear error logged. User can re-trigger by re-editing entity.

### Webhook Signature Validation

**Current:** Trusts webhook source based on token presence

**Future:** Implement HMAC signature validation for additional security

**Priority:** Low (Entu validates webhook endpoint URL registration)

### Monitoring Dashboard

**Current:** Monitor via server logs only

**Future:** Web UI showing:

- Recent webhook activity
- Success/failure rates
- Which users trigger most webhooks
- Permission grant statistics

**Priority:** Medium (logs are sufficient for now)
