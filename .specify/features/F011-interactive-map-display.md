# F011 - Interactive Map Display

## Summary

Replace the placeholder TaskMapCard component with a real interactive map that displays the user's current location and the 5 closest unvisited task locations, with smart zoom to fit all locations in view.

## User Story

As a museum visitor using the ESM Map App, I want to see an interactive map showing my current location and nearby unvisited task locations, so that I can visualize the geographical context and plan my route efficiently.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality

- **Interactive Map**: Replace `TaskMapCard.vue` placeholder with real map using Leaflet.js
- **User Location**: Display user's GPS position with distinctive marker (üìç)
- **Task Locations**: Show location markers for tasks with geographical data
- **Unvisited Filter**: Only display locations that haven't been completed by the user
- **5-Closest Logic**: Limit display to the 5 nearest unvisited locations
- **Smart Zoom**: Automatically calculate zoom level and center to fit all displayed locations

### Integration Points

- **GPS Service**: Leverage existing `useLocation()` composable for user position
- **Location Data**: Use existing location loading from `loadTaskLocations()`
- **Distance Calculation**: Utilize `utils/distance.js` for sorting and filtering
- **Task System**: Integrate with task completion status to filter unvisited locations

### Technical Implementation

#### Dependencies

```bash
npm install leaflet @vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet
```

#### Component Architecture

```text
InteractiveMap.vue (new)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Map container with Leaflet
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User location marker
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task location markers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Auto-zoom calculation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Location popups

TaskMapCard.vue (updated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Replace placeholder with InteractiveMap
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pass props: locations, userPosition, completedTasks
```

#### Data Flow

1. TaskDetailPanel loads task locations via `loadTaskLocations()`
2. Filter locations to unvisited using task completion status
3. Sort by distance and take closest 5 using `sortLocationsByDistance()`
4. Pass filtered locations to InteractiveMap component
5. Map calculates bounds and sets appropriate zoom level
6. Display user marker + location markers with popups

### User Experience

- **Visual Clarity**: Distinct markers for user vs task locations
- **Information**: Clickable location markers with name/description popups
- **Responsive**: Map adjusts to container size and device type
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with location limits
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Acceptance Criteria

1. ‚úÖ Map displays when task has location data (`hasMapData = true`)
2. ‚úÖ User's GPS location appears as distinctive marker
3. ‚úÖ Only unvisited task locations are shown (max 5 closest)
4. ‚úÖ Map automatically zooms to fit all displayed locations
5. ‚úÖ Location markers show name/description when clicked
6. ‚úÖ Map is responsive and works on mobile devices
7. ‚úÖ Graceful fallback when GPS permission denied
8. ‚úÖ Loading states during location fetch and map initialization

### Technical Considerations

- **Bundle Size**: Leaflet is lightweight (~40KB) and suitable for production
- **No API Keys**: Uses OpenStreetMap tiles, no external service costs
- **Performance**: Limit to 5 locations prevents map clutter and performance issues
- **Offline Support**: Basic map tiles can be cached for offline viewing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when location services unavailable

### Related Features

- **F004**: Smart Location Selection (GPS integration)
- **F008**: Answer Submission (location context for responses)
- **F010**: Component Refactoring (clean component architecture)

### Implementation Priority

**High** - This enhances the core user experience by providing geographical context for task locations, making the app more intuitive and useful for museum visitors navigating physical spaces.

## File Changes

- Create: `app/components/InteractiveMap.vue`
- Update: `app/components/TaskMapCard.vue`
- Update: `app/components/TaskDetailPanel.vue` (integration)
- Update: `package.json` (add Leaflet dependencies)
