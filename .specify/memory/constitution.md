# ESMuseum Map App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development

Every feature MUST begin with a complete specification before any implementation. Specifications MUST be written for business stakeholders, avoiding technical implementation details. All requirements MUST be testable and unambiguous with clear acceptance criteria. No code shall be written without approved specifications defining user value and success criteria.

**Rationale**: The interactive map domain requires clear understanding of user workflows, museum data relationships, and educational task requirements before technical implementation. Estonian Museum context demands precise specification to avoid cultural and institutional misunderstandings.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD methodology is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. Contract tests required for all API integrations including Entu database system. Integration tests mandatory for map rendering, geolocation services, and task submission workflows.

**Rationale**: Museum data integrity and educational task accuracy are critical. Map applications have complex state management requiring comprehensive test coverage. Estonian cultural heritage data demands verification at every level.

### III. Modular Component Architecture

Features MUST be implemented as self-contained, independently testable modules. Vue.js components MUST follow single responsibility principle with clear composable abstractions. Each module MUST have defined interfaces, minimal dependencies, and comprehensive documentation. No organizational-only modules permitted.

**Rationale**: Interactive map applications have inherent complexity requiring clear separation of concerns. Museum domain logic, mapping services, and educational workflows must remain decoupled for maintainability and testing.

### IV. Progressive Enhancement & Accessibility

Application MUST function without JavaScript for core content viewing. Interactive features progressively enhance the experience. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory for all user interfaces. Internationalization support required for Estonian and English languages throughout the application.

**Rationale**: Museums serve diverse audiences including visitors with varying technical capabilities and accessibility needs. Estonian cultural institutions must support both local and international visitors with appropriate language and accessibility accommodations.

### V. Data Integrity & Security

All museum data interactions MUST preserve data integrity through validation and error handling. Authentication and authorization MUST follow Estonian digital identity standards. Personal data handling MUST comply with GDPR requirements. Educational task submissions require secure storage and retrieval mechanisms.

**Rationale**: Museum collections and educational content represent significant cultural value requiring protection. Estonian institutions must adhere to EU data protection standards while maintaining educational accessibility.

## Educational Technology Standards

Interactive educational tasks MUST support offline capability for field usage. Geolocation-based activities MUST gracefully handle GPS limitations and provide manual coordinate input alternatives. Task submission system MUST support multimedia content including images and text responses. Progress tracking MUST persist across sessions and devices.

**Rationale**: Museum field activities occur in various environments with inconsistent network connectivity. Educational effectiveness requires reliable task completion and progress preservation regardless of technical constraints.

## Performance & User Experience

Application MUST load core content within 3 seconds on 3G connections. Map rendering MUST respond to user interactions within 200ms. Educational tasks MUST save progress automatically every 30 seconds. Mobile-first responsive design mandatory with touch-optimized interactions for all age groups.

**Rationale**: Museum visitors use mobile devices extensively and expect immediate responsiveness. Educational applications must accommodate various age groups and technical skill levels while maintaining engagement through smooth interactions.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other development practices and technical decisions. All features and pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance before approval. Complexity deviations require explicit justification and documentation in implementation plans. Constitutional amendments require stakeholder approval and migration planning.

Development guidance and runtime support documented in `.specify/templates/agent-file-template.md` for GitHub Copilot integration. Regular constitutional compliance reviews conducted during feature planning and implementation phases.
