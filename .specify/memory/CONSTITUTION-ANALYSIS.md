# Constitution Template Analysis for ES Museum Map App

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Purpose**: Evaluate spec-kit constitution examples against our project context

---

## üìã Template Examples Analyzed

From `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, the template provides these example principles:

### Example I: Library-First

> "Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries"

### Example II: CLI Interface

> "Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args ‚Üí stdout, errors ‚Üí stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats"

### Example III: Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> "TDD mandatory: Tests written ‚Üí User approved ‚Üí Tests fail ‚Üí Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced"

### Example IV: Integration Testing

> "Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas"

### Example V: Multiple Options

> "Observability: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required"
> "Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format"
> "Simplicity: Start simple, YAGNI principles"

## üéØ Applicability Analysis

### ‚úÖ HIGHLY APPLICABLE (Adopt with Adaptation)

#### 1. Test-First Principle (Example III)

**Applicability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (95%)

**Current State**:

- We have Vitest setup with coverage
- Test scripts in package.json (unit, api, composables, coverage)
- Tests exist but TDD not formally enforced

**Adaptation**:

```markdown
### III. Test-First Development (HIGH PRIORITY)

Tests should be written before implementation where practical:

- New features: Write tests first, get approval, then implement
- Bug fixes: Write failing test reproducing issue, then fix
- Refactoring: Maintain test coverage throughout

Exceptions allowed for:

- Rapid prototyping (must add tests before PR)
- UI/UX experimentation (document decision to defer)
- Third-party integration exploration

Test coverage targets:

- Composables: >80%
- API endpoints: >90%
- Critical business logic: 100%
```

**Why Adopt**: Testing is already part of our workflow, formalizing it raises quality bar

---

#### 2. Type Safety Principle (Inspired by Example I + Our keywords.txt)

**Applicability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (100%)

**Current State**:

- TypeScript project
- `.github/keywords.txt` contains "Golden Rules" for `as any`
- Active effort to improve type safety

**Adaptation**:

```markdown
### I. Type Safety First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TypeScript must be leveraged fully:

- Avoid `any` type - every usage must be documented
- When `any` is necessary:
  1. Add comment explaining why
  2. Document plan for removal or justification to keep
  3. Prefer type guards over type casts
- Document JavaScript boundaries clearly
- Use strict TypeScript configuration

Type safety is not just compilation - it's documentation and correctness.
```

**Why Adopt**: Already our practice (keywords.txt), formalizing it into constitution ensures continuity

---

#### 3. Composable-First Architecture (Adapted from Example I)

**Applicability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (85%)

**Current State**:

- Vue 3 Composition API with composables
- 15+ composables in `app/composables/`
- Already composable-driven architecture

**Adaptation**:

```markdown
### II. Composable-First Development

Features should be implemented as reusable composables:

- Self-contained with clear single responsibility
- Independently testable (unit tests required)
- Well-documented with TypeScript types
- Composable must have clear purpose - no "utility grab bags"

Structure:

- `app/composables/` for business logic
- Component-specific composables in component folders
- Server composables in `server/utils/`

Benefits: Reusability, testability, maintainability
```

**Why Adopt**: Aligns perfectly with Vue 3 best practices and our current architecture

---

#### 4. Observability & Logging (Example V)

**Applicability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (70%)

**Current State**:

- Pino logger configured (package.json dependencies)
- Some console logging exists
- Logging not standardized

**Adaptation**:

```markdown
### IV. Observable Development

Code must be debuggable in production:

- Use structured logging (pino) over console.log
- Log levels: error (user-facing issues), warn (degraded), info (lifecycle), debug (development)
- Include context: userId, taskId, location, action
- Client-side: Capture errors with user-friendly messages
- Server-side: Detailed logs without exposing sensitive data

Error boundaries required for:

- API calls (network failures)
- User input processing (validation)
- Third-party integrations (Entu, Leaflet)
```

**Why Adopt**: Critical for production debugging, we have the infrastructure (pino)

---

### üî∂ PARTIALLY APPLICABLE (Adapt Significantly)

#### 5. Simplicity & YAGNI (Example V)

**Applicability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (80%)

**Current State**:

- Small team, rapid iteration
- Some over-engineering risk (many archived optimizations in docs)

**Adaptation**:

```markdown
### V. Pragmatic Simplicity

Start simple, add complexity only when justified:

- YAGNI: Don't implement features "for the future"
- Optimize after measuring: Profile before optimizing
- Prefer boring technology: Established patterns over clever solutions
- Refactor continuously: Keep code simple as it evolves

Balance: Simple doesn't mean simplistic - invest in good architecture upfront.

Document "optimization opportunities" in `.copilot-docs/` rather than implementing speculatively.
```

**Why Adapt**: We have a history of over-optimization (docs/AS_ANY_AUDIT.md, docs/OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md)

---

#### 6. Integration Testing (Example IV)

**Applicability**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (65%)

**Current State**:

- Vitest with @nuxt/test-utils
- API tests exist (`tests/api/`)
- No formal integration test strategy

**Adaptation**:

```markdown
### VI. Strategic Integration Testing

Focus integration tests on critical paths:

- API contract tests: Entu authentication, task fetching
- Data flow: User submission ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Entu
- Third-party boundaries: Entu API, map tile providers
- Critical user journeys: Login ‚Üí Task selection ‚Üí Submission

Not required for:

- Pure UI components (unit tests sufficient)
- Internal helper functions
- Simple CRUD operations
```

**Why Adapt**: Full integration testing is expensive, focus on high-value areas

---

### ‚ùå NOT APPLICABLE (Skip or Defer)

#### 7. Library-First Architecture (Example I)

**Applicability**: ‚≠ê (20%)

**Reason**: We're a single Nuxt.js application, not a library/package ecosystem
**Alternative**: Composable-First principle (already covered above)

---

#### 8. CLI Interface (Example II)

**Applicability**: ‚≠ê (10%)

**Reason**: Web application, not a CLI tool
**Alternative**: API-First principle for server routes
**Possible Adaptation**:

```markdown
### VII. API-First Server Design

Server routes should be clean and testable:

- Clear input validation (Nuxt server utilities)
- Structured responses (JSON)
- Proper error codes (4xx client, 5xx server)
- Documented contracts (TypeScript types)
```

**Status**: Consider for future if we formalize API patterns
