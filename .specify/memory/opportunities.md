# Optimization Opportunities Log

**Purpose**: Track suspicious patterns and optimization opportunities discovered during development.  
**Principle**: Log and continue - don't lose focus on current task (Constitution Principle V).

**Guidelines**:

- Keep this file focused on **active** opportunities only
- Maximum ~20 active items - when full, prioritize or archive
- Move reviewed/rejected items to `opportunities-archive.md`
- Include date, context, and discovery location
- Review monthly and clean up

## Active Opportunities

<!-- Format: - [ ] [YYYY-MM-DD] Brief description | Discovered in: file/feature | Impact: low/medium/high -->

- [ ] [2025-10-03] **Code Duplication**: TaskLocationOverride vs TaskMapCard have near-identical manual coordinate override functionality | Discovered in: Component migration | Impact: medium | Consider extracting to useManualCoordinates() composable or consolidating
- [ ] [2025-10-05] **Duplicate Token Expiry Logic**: Proactive (middleware) + Reactive (API) token checking | Discovered in: F025 | Impact: low | Monitor in production - might be good defensive duplication or unnecessary overhead
- [ ] [2025-10-05] **Magic Status Codes**: HTTP status codes (401, 403, 500) as magic numbers in error-handling.ts | Discovered in: F025 | Impact: low | Consider HTTP_STATUS constants for readability
- [ ] [2025-10-05] **Magic Notification Durations**: Hardcoded durations (4000, 4500, 5000 ms) in useNotifications.ts | Discovered in: F025 | Impact: low | Consider NOTIFICATION_DURATION constants with comments
- [ ] [2025-10-05] **Event Logging in Middleware**: 6 console.log statements with üîí markers in auth.ts | Discovered in: F025 | Impact: low | Review if all logs needed now that notifications provide feedback
- [ ] [2025-10-05] **i18n Translation Namespacing**: Flat structure (auth.sessionExpired) vs nested (auth.errors.sessionExpired.title) | Discovered in: F025 | Impact: very-low | Would require refactor, cosmetic improvement
- [ ] [2025-10-03] **Response Entity Search Patterns**: Three files search for responses with similar patterns | Discovered in: Phase 1 | Impact: medium | Could create shared searchUserResponses() utility
- [ ] [2025-10-03] **Page Initialization Log**: index.vue has üöÄ [EVENT] script setup log | Discovered in: Phase 1 | Impact: low | Review if still needed for debugging
