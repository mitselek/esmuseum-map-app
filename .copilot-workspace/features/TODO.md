# TODO

- [x] Link locations on map to locations in selection list
  - if location selected on map, select the same location in list
  - if location selected in list, highlight the same location on map
- [x] If location with responses is selected, show responses in detail view (can we show it in leaflet popup?)
  - âœ… EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - See `feature/popup-responses` branch (commit 65ff57c)
  - Full ResponseCard component with compact layout for popups
  - Navigation controls for multiple responses per location
  - Complete i18n translations and comprehensive F017 documentation
  - Status: ON HOLD - UX feasibility needs evaluation, compact popup design may not be optimal
  - Alternative approaches to consider: modal overlay, sidebar integration, or expandable popup views
- [x] Find all places, where we are checking for ._id but actually should only look for .reference (e.g. in useTaskDetail.ts)
- [x] find out, why was expanding options after headers in callApi critical for POST requests - was it just a timing issue or something else?
- [x] remove the certs from the repo!
- [x] could we use typescript interfaces to define the shape of Entu entities (e.g. Task, Response, Location) and use them across the app for better type safety and autocompletion?
  - âœ… **COMPLETED IN F022** - See `feature/F022-entu-entity-types` branch
  - **ACHIEVEMENT**: ðŸŽ‰ **100% COMPOSABLE TYPE COVERAGE** (9/9 composables migrated!)
  - Created comprehensive type system in `types/entu.ts` with base types, entity interfaces, and type guards
  - Added utility helpers in `utils/entu-helpers.ts` for type-safe value extraction
  - Migrated ALL JavaScript composables to TypeScript (~2,089 JS â†’ ~2,665 TS, +576 interfaces)
  - Fixed 4 critical bugs during migration (variable naming, user._id, iOS permissions, missing exports)
  - iOS GPS flow tested and working (3 Safari scenarios verified)
  - Complete documentation: `.copilot-workspace/features/F022-COMPOSABLE-MIGRATION.md`
  - **Status**: âœ… **READY TO MERGE TO MAIN** ðŸš€
