# TODO

- [x] Link locations on map to locations in selection list
  - if location selected on map, select the same location in list
  - if location selected in list, highlight the same location on map
- [x] If location with responses is selected, show responses in detail view (can we show it in leaflet popup?)
  - EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - See `feature/popup-responses` branch (commit 65ff57c)
  - Full ResponseCard component with compact layout for popups
  - Navigation controls for multiple responses per location
  - Complete i18n translations and comprehensive F017 documentation
  - Status: ON HOLD - UX feasibility needs evaluation, compact popup design may not be optimal
  - Alternative approaches to consider: modal overlay, sidebar integration, or expandable popup views
- [x] Find all places, where we are checking for ._id but actually should only look for .reference (e.g. in useTaskDetail.ts)
- [x] find out, why was expanding options after headers in callApi critical for POST requests - was it just a timing issue or something else?
- [x] remove the certs from the repo!
- [x] **F017: GitHub Spec Kit Selective Adoption** - Research and formalize transition to Spec-Driven Development
  - âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE - September 19, 2025
  - Constitutional framework established with 9 ESMuseum-specific articles
  - Enhanced feature templates and quality gates implemented
  - Compliance checklists and workflow documentation created
  - Status: Ready for F018+ features using new Spec-Driven Development methodology
- [ ] **TypeScript Interfaces for Entu Entities** - Define comprehensive interfaces for better type safety
  - Status: DEFERRED until after Spec-Driven Development migration is complete
  - Rationale: Focus on process enhancement first, then apply new methodology to TypeScript interfaces
  - Will be implemented as F018+ using new constitutional framework and enhanced workflow
