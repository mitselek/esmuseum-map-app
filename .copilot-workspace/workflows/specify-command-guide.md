# Feature Specification Creation Guide (`/specify`)

Implementation of the `/specify` workflow for structured feature creation

**Version**: 1.0  
**Authority**: F017 Phase 2 Implementation  
**Purpose**: Systematic feature specification creation with constitutional compliance

---

## Overview

The `/specify` command equivalent creates comprehensive, unambiguous feature specifications following our enhanced Spec-Driven Development methodology. This process ensures constitutional compliance and specification completeness before any implementation begins.

---

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Feature Specification

**Command Equivalent**:

```bash
# Navigate to features directory
cd .copilot-workspace/features/

# Determine next feature number
ls -1 F*.md | sort -V | tail -1
# Example output: F017-spec-kit-adoption.md
# Next feature: F018

# Create new feature specification
cp ../templates/feature-spec-template.md F018-feature-name.md
```

**Naming Convention**:

- Format: `F###-feature-name.md`
- Use kebab-case for feature names
- Include descriptive but concise feature name
- Sequential numbering starting from F018

### Step 2: Complete Feature Specification

#### 2.1 Basic Information

- **Replace Feature Title**: Update with descriptive feature name
- **Set Date**: Current date when specification begins
- **Define Overview**: One-sentence feature description
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Reference relevant constitutional articles

#### 2.2 Feature Summary

- **What**: Clear description of what will be built
- **Why**: Business justification and user value
- **Approach**: High-level implementation strategy
- **Timeline**: Expected development timeline

#### 2.3 Business Value Documentation

- **Primary Benefits**: 3-5 specific impacts on users/business
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes with specific targets
- **User Value Proposition**: Clear articulation of end-user benefits

#### 2.4 User Stories Creation

- **Primary User Type**: Core users (students, visitors, researchers)
- **Secondary User Type**: Supporting users (administrators, content managers)
- **System/AI Assistant**: Technical stakeholders if applicable
- **Format**: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"

#### 2.5 Acceptance Criteria Definition

- **Phase-Based Structure**: Break into logical implementation phases
- **Measurable Deliverables**: Each criterion must be testable
- **Clear Definition of Done**: Unambiguous completion criteria
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Include compliance validation

### Step 3: Constitutional Compliance Review

#### 3.1 Complete Compliance Checklist

Reference: `.copilot-workspace/templates/constitutional-compliance-checklist.md`

**Article I - Vue 3 Composition API**: Document component architecture approach
**Article II - TypeScript-First**: Define TypeScript interfaces and type safety
**Article III - Test-Driven Development**: Specify test-first implementation strategy
**Article IV - i18n-First UI**: Plan internationalization for all user-facing content
**Article V - Entu API Standards**: Document API integration patterns
**Article VI - Performance-First SPA**: Assess performance impact and optimization
**Article VII - Component Modularity**: Define component structure and boundaries
**Article VIII - Documentation-Driven**: Plan documentation requirements
**Article IX - Responsive Design**: Specify mobile-first and accessibility approach

#### 3.2 Quality Gates Validation

- **Specification Completeness Gate**: No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain
- **Constitutional Compliance Gate**: All 9 articles reviewed and documented
- **Stakeholder Validation Gate**: Business value and user stories validated

### Step 4: Specification Refinement

#### 4.1 Resolve Ambiguities

- **Address `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers**: Replace with specific decisions
- **Validate assumptions**: Confirm with stakeholders where needed
- **Document explicit decisions**: Record rationale for ambiguous requirements

#### 4.2 Technical Architecture Preview

- **Component Structure**: High-level component organization
- **API Integration**: Required Entu API interactions
- **State Management**: Reactive state and composables approach
- **Performance Considerations**: Bundle size and rendering impact

#### 4.3 Testing Strategy Overview

- **Contract Tests**: API and component interface validation
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow validation
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function and composable testing

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

### Feature Naming Conventions

- **UI Components**: `F###-component-name`
- **API Integrations**: `F###-api-feature-name`
- **Workflow Improvements**: `F###-process-enhancement`
- **Performance Optimizations**: `F###-performance-improvement`

**Student/Visitor Pattern**:

- As a student visiting the museum, I want [functionality] so that I can learn more effectively

**Researcher Pattern**:

- As a researcher studying Estonian history, I want [functionality] so that I can access detailed information

**Administrator Pattern**:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Specification feels too detailed for simple features
**Solution**: Use template sections selectively, but ensure constitutional compliance

**Issue**: Unclear how to measure success metrics
**Solution**: Focus on user behavior changes and technical performance indicators

**Issue**: Constitutional compliance seems repetitive
**Solution**: Reference previous features for established patterns, document differences

**Issue**: User stories overlap between features
**Solution**: Reference related features and focus on unique value proposition

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL - Ready for F018+ Feature Specifications  
**Next Phase**: `/plan` - Technical Implementation Planning  
**Validation**: Constitutional compliance and quality gates must be satisfied
