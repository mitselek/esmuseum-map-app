- **Stakeholder Validation**: Business value and user stories confirmed

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Specification has no `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers
- [ ] All constitutional articles compliance documented
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable and testable
- [ ] Business value clearly articulated

---

## Planning Process

### Step 1: Architecture Design

#### 1.1 Component Structure Analysis

**Constitutional Reference**: Article VII (Component Modularity Principle)

**Process**:

1. **Identify Core Components**: Based on user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **Define Component Boundaries**: Single responsibility and clear interfaces
3. **Plan Component Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships and data flow
4. **Assess Reusability**: Shared components vs feature-specific components

**Output Template**:

```typescript
// Component Architecture Plan
interface ComponentStructure {
  primary: {
    name: string; // Main feature component
    responsibility: string; // Single, clear purpose
    size_estimate: number; // Estimated lines of code (≤200)
    dependencies: string[]; // External component dependencies
  };
  supporting: Array<{
    name: string;
    responsibility: string;
    parent: string; // Which component uses this
    reusable: boolean; // Can be used by other features
  }>;
  shared: Array<{
    name: string;
    location: string; // app/components/shared/
    enhancement: boolean; // Enhancing existing vs new
  }>;
}
```

#### 1.2 State Management Strategy

**Constitutional Reference**: Article I (Vue 3 Composition API Mandate)

**Process**:

1. **Identify Reactive State**: What data needs to be reactive
2. **Plan Composables**: Reusable logic extraction
3. **Define State Scope**: Component-local vs shared state
4. **Document State Flow**: How data moves between components

**Planning Questions**:

- What data is component-specific vs shared?
- Which existing composables can be reused?
- What new composables need to be created?
- How does state persist between user sessions?

#### 1.3 API Integration Design

**Constitutional Reference**: Article V (Entu API Integration Standards)

**Process**:

1. **Map Required Endpoints**: Which Entu API endpoints are needed
2. **Define Data Flow**: Request/response patterns
3. **Plan Error Handling**: Network failures and API errors
4. **Design Composable Interfaces**: Clean separation of concerns

**API Planning Template**:

```typescript
interface APIIntegrationPlan {
  endpoints: Array<{
    method: "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE";
    path: string;
    purpose: string;
    authentication: boolean;
    composable: string; // Which composable handles this
  }>;
  error_handling: {
    network_failures: string;
    authentication_errors: string;
    validation_errors: string;
    user_feedback: string;
  };
  caching_strategy?: string;
}
```

### Step 2: Constitutional Architecture Review

#### 2.1 Article-by-Article Compliance Planning

**Article I - Vue 3 Composition API**:

- [ ] All components use `<script setup>` syntax
- [ ] Reactive state properly managed with `ref()`, `reactive()`, `computed()`
- [ ] Composables follow `use*` naming convention

- [ ] Translation key structure planned
- [ ] Three locale support (et, en, uk) confirmed

**Article V - Entu API Integration Standards**:

- [ ] OAuth authentication flow documented
- [ ] API composable patterns followed
- [ ] Error handling standards implemented

**Article VI - Performance-First SPA Architecture**:

- [ ] Bundle size impact assessed
- [ ] Code splitting opportunities identified
- [ ] Mobile performance considerations documented

**Article VII - Component Modularity Principle**:

- [ ] API documentation requirements specified
- [ ] User documentation updates identified

**Article IX - Responsive Design Requirements**:

- [ ] Mobile-first approach documented
- [ ] Accessibility standards planned (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility ensured

#### 2.2 Constitutional Compliance Documentation

For each article, document:

1. **How the feature complies** with the constitutional requirement
2. **What specific implementations** will enforce compliance
3. **Any exceptions** and their justifications
4. **Validation methods** to ensure ongoing compliance

### Step 3: Technology Selection and Dependencies

#### 3.1 Dependency Evaluation

**Process**:

1. **Assess New Dependencies**: Are any new packages needed?
2. **Constitutional Compliance**: Do dependencies align with our principles?
3. **Performance Impact**: Bundle size and performance implications
4. **Alternative Evaluation**: Are there lighter/better alternatives?

**Dependency Decision Matrix**:

```markdown
| Dependency | Purpose   | Size Impact | Constitutional Alignment | Alternative Considered | Decision         |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| [package]  | [purpose] | [kb]        | [compliance notes]       | [alternatives]         | [approve/reject] |
```

#### 3.2 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:

- **Complexity Risk**: Is the implementation too complex for the value?
- **Performance Risk**: Will this impact Core Web Vitals?
- **Maintenance Risk**: How will this affect future development?
- **Integration Risk**: How does this interact with existing features?

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Complexity**: Break into smaller phases, simplify approach
- **Performance**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading
- **Maintenance**: Document thoroughly, follow modular principles
- **Integration**: Plan compatibility layers, test integration points

### Step 4: Implementation Roadmap Creation

#### 4.1 Development Phases

Break implementation into logical phases with clear deliverables:

**Phase Structure**:

```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation ([Timeline])

- [ ] [Specific deliverable]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable]

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ([Timeline])

- [ ] [Specific deliverable]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable]

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish ([Timeline])

- [ ] [Specific deliverable]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable]
```

#### 4.2 Test-First Implementation Plan

**Constitutional Reference**: Article III (Test-Driven Feature Development)

**Implementation Sequence**:

1. **Contract Definition**: API and component interface contracts
2. **Contract Tests**: Validate interfaces before implementation
3. **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interaction testing
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow validation
5. **Unit Tests**: Individual function and composable testing
6. **Implementation**: Code to satisfy all tests

#### 4.3 Performance Optimization Strategy

**Optimization Areas**:

- **Bundle Size**: Code splitting and tree shaking
- **Runtime Performance**: Component rendering optimization
- **User Experience**: Loading states and perceived performance
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS compliance

## Common Planning Patterns

### Component Architecture Patterns

```typescript
// Feature Component Pattern
FeatureMain.vue          // Primary component (≤200 lines)
├── FeatureHeader.vue    // Header/title component
├── FeatureContent.vue   // Main content area
├── FeatureActions.vue   // Action buttons/controls
└── types.ts            // TypeScript interfaces
```

### API Integration Patterns

```typescript
// Composable Pattern
export const useFeatureData = () => {
  const { callApi } = useEntuApi();
  const loading = ref(false);
  const error = ref(null);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    // Implementation with error handling
  };

  return { fetchData, loading, error };
};
```

### State Management Patterns

```typescript
// Feature State Pattern
export const useFeatureState = () => {
  const state = reactive({
    items: [],
    selectedItem: null,
    filters: {},
  });

  const actions = {
    selectItem: (item) => {
      /* implementation */
    },
    updateFilters: (filters) => {
      /* implementation */
    },
  };

  return { state: readonly(state), ...actions };
};
```
