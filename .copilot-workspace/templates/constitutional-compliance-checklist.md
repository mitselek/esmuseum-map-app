2. **Validate Compliance**: Confirm constitutional compliance documentation
3. **Assess Quality Gates**: Verify all gates are properly satisfied
4. **Document Approval**: Record review completion and approval

### For Implementers

## Compliance Enforcement

### Automated Validation

Where possible, constitutional compliance is enforced through:

- **ESLint Rules**: TypeScript and Vue 3 Composition API compliance
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript interface coverage validation
- **Test Coverage**: Automated test coverage reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Bundle size and performance regression detection

### Manual Review Process

Constitutional compliance requires manual validation for:

- **Architecture Decisions**: Component modularity and design patterns
- **Documentation Quality**: Specification completeness and clarity
- **Test Strategy**: Contract-first approach and coverage adequacy
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards adherence

---

**Authority**: These checklists implement the requirements of the ESMuseum Constitutional Framework and must be completed for all feature development.

**Maintenance**: Checklists will be updated as constitutional articles are amended or development practices evolve.
