### F006: Server API Routes for Form Submission (September 6, 2025)

**Status**: ðŸš§ Planning

#### Overview

Replace direct Entu API calls in components with dedicated Nuxt server API routes for better architecture, validation, error handling, and security.

#### Planned Architecture

```text
server/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ responses/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.post.ts          # Create new response
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [id].put.ts            # Update existing response
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [id].get.ts            # Get response by ID
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user/[userId].get.ts   # Get user's responses for task
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [id].get.ts            # Get task details with enhanced data
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [id]/responses.get.ts  # Get all responses for task (admin)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [id]/locations.get.ts  # Get task locations with computed distances
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ files/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ upload.post.ts         # Handle file uploads to Entu
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [id].get.ts            # Serve/proxy files from Entu
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ validate.post.ts       # Validate token and return user info
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ refresh.post.ts        # Refresh token
```

#### Phase 1: Response Management API

- **POST `/api/responses`**: Create new task response
  - Validation: text OR file required, task and user validation
  - File upload handling with Entu integration
  - Response entity creation with proper relationships
  - Return structured response with success/error states

- **PUT `/api/responses/[id]`**: Update existing response
  - Ownership validation (user can only edit their responses)
  - Merge updates with existing data
  - Handle file replacement scenarios
  - Audit trail for response changes

- **GET `/api/responses/[id]`**: Get specific response
  - Authorization check (user access control)
  - Include file references and metadata
  - Response formatting for frontend consumption

- **GET `/api/responses/user/[userId]`**: Get user's responses for task
  - Query parameter: `taskId` for filtering
  - Include response status and submission timestamps
  - Handle pagination for users with many responses

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Task API

- **GET `/api/tasks/[id]`**: Get task with computed data
  - Include user's existing response if any
  - Add response count and metadata
  - Include location data with distance calculations
  - Permission checks for task access

- **GET `/api/tasks/[id]/locations`**: Get locations with distances
  - Accept user coordinates as query parameters
  - Return sorted locations by distance
  - Include location metadata and descriptions
  - Caching for performance optimization

#### Phase 3: File Management API

- **POST `/api/files/upload`**: Handle file uploads
  - Multipart form data processing
  - File type and size validation
  - Integration with Entu file storage API
  - Return file reference for response linking

- **GET `/api/files/[id]`**: Serve files (proxy from Entu)
  - Authorization checks for file access
  - Proper content-type headers
  - Caching strategies for performance

#### Phase 4: Authentication API

- **POST `/api/auth/validate`**: Validate token
  - Token verification and user data extraction
  - Return user info with permissions
  - Rate limiting for security

- **POST `/api/auth/refresh`**: Refresh expired tokens
  - Seamless token renewal
  - Updated user data synchronization

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Error Handling Strategy:**

```typescript
// Standardized error response format
interface APIError {
  success: false
  error: {
    code: string
    message: string
    details?: any
  }
  timestamp: string
}

// Success response format
interface APISuccess<T> {
  success: true
  data: T
  timestamp: string
  meta?: {
    pagination?: PaginationInfo
    cache?: CacheInfo
  }
}
```

**Validation Framework:**

- Use Zod or similar for request validation
- Standardized validation error responses
- Type-safe request/response interfaces

**Security Measures:**

- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- Request size limits for file uploads
- Authorization middleware for protected routes

#### Frontend Integration

**New Composable: `useTaskResponseAPI`**

```javascript
export const useTaskResponseAPI = () => {
  const submitResponse = async (taskId, responseData) => {
    return await $fetch('/api/responses', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: { taskId, ...responseData }
    })
  }

  const updateResponse = async (responseId, updates) => {
    return await $fetch(`/api/responses/${responseId}`, {
      method: 'PUT',
      body: updates
    })
  }

  const getUserResponse = async (taskId) => {
    return await $fetch(`/api/responses/user/${userId}?taskId=${taskId}`)
  }

  return { submitResponse, updateResponse, getUserResponse }
}
```

**Updated Component Usage:**

- Replace direct Entu API calls with server API calls
- Improved error handling with structured responses
- Better loading states with API response metadata
- Simplified component logic with server-side processing

#### Benefits

1. **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns, business logic on server
2. **Security**: Server-side validation, token handling, rate limiting
3. **Performance**: Caching, optimized queries, reduced client-server round trips
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized API logic, easier testing and debugging
5. **User Experience**: Better error messages, loading states, offline capabilities
6. **Scalability**: Easier to add middleware, monitoring, and scaling strategies

#### Success Criteria

- All form submissions go through server API routes
- File uploads work seamlessly with progress indication
- Error handling provides clear user feedback
- Performance is equal or better than direct API calls
- API endpoints are well-documented and type-safe
- Integration tests cover all API endpoints
