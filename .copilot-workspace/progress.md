## Active Development

### F004: Smart Location Selection for Task Responses (September 5, 2025)

**Status**: âœ… Complete

#### Phase 1: âœ… Data Loading & API Integration

- âœ… Load task's associated map references
- âœ… Fetch all locations for task maps via Entu API
- âœ… Parse coordinate data from location entities
- âœ… Integration with existing Entu data model

#### Phase 2: âœ… Distance Calculation

- âœ… Implement haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
- âœ… Create utility functions for coordinate parsing and validation
- âœ… Sort locations by proximity to user position
- âœ… Handle edge cases (missing coordinates, invalid data)

#### Phase 3: âœ… UI Enhancement

- âœ… Design and implement LocationPicker component
- âœ… Replace basic coordinate input with smart location selector
- âœ… Add distance display and location metadata
- âœ… Implement search/filter functionality for large location lists

#### Phase 4: âœ… User Experience

- âœ… Loading states for location data and GPS requests
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling for GPS and API failures
- âœ… Fallback to manual coordinate entry
- âœ… Visual feedback for location selection and status

#### Technical Achievements

- **New Files Created**:
  - `app/utils/distance.js` - Distance calculation utilities with haversine formula
  - `app/components/LocationPicker.vue` - Smart location selection component
  - `app/composables/useLocation.js` - Location management composable
- **Enhanced Files**:
  - `app/pages/opilane/ulesanne/[id].vue` - Integrated location picker into task response form
- **Key Features**:
  - Proximity-based location sorting (closest first)
  - Real-time distance calculations and display
  - GPS integration with fallback to manual entry
  - Search and filter capabilities for location lists
  - Responsive design optimized for mobile devices

#### User Experience Improvements

- Students can now see all available locations for their task
- Locations are automatically sorted by distance from current position
- Clear visual feedback with distance indicators
- Seamless fallback between GPS, location selection, and manual coordinate entry
- Search functionality for quick location finding

#### Next Steps

- âœ… **Testing**: User testing with real location data completed
- âœ… **Performance**: Optimization for large location datasets implemented
- âœ… **Enhancement**: GPS auto-request and location reordering completed
- ðŸ”„ **Analytics**: Location selection pattern analysis (future enhancement)
