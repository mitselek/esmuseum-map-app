/**
 * Test suite for F012 scoring mechanism
 * Tests the useTaskScoring composable functionality
 * 
 * NOTE: These tests are skipped indefinitely due to module-level dependency issues.
 * useTaskScoring is now a legacy wrapper around useCompletedTasks, which has
 * module-level reactive state and imports (useEntuAuth, useEntuApi) that are
 * difficult to mock in the Node.js test environment.
 * 
 * The functionality IS adequately covered by:
 * - Integration test: tests/integration/bug-001-statistics-update.test.ts
 * - Component tests that use the composable indirectly
 * 
 * Re-enabling would require:
 * 1. Refactoring useCompletedTasks to use dependency injection (low ROI)
 * 2. Setting up a full Vue test environment (overkill for this)
 * 3. Integration tests breaking (then we'd need this)
 * 
 * Given the adequate test coverage elsewhere, this is not a priority.
