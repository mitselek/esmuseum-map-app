/**
 * Test suite for F012 scoring mechanism
 * Tests the useTaskScoring composable functionality
 * 
 * NOTE: These tests are currently skipped due to module-level dependency issues.
 * useTaskScoring is now a legacy wrapper around useCompletedTasks, which has
 * module-level reactive state and imports (useEntuAuth, useEntuApi) that are
 * difficult to mock in the Node.js test environment.
 * 
 * TODO: Consider either:
 * 1. Refactoring useCompletedTasks to be more test-friendly (inject dependencies)
 * 2. Migrating these tests to integration tests that run in a proper Vue environment
 * 3. Testing the actual components that use useTaskScoring instead
 * 
 * The functionality is covered by:
 * - Integration test: tests/integration/bug-001-statistics-update.test.ts
 * - Component tests that use the composable indirectly
